If the app does not connect, try using bridges (or a different type of bridge), force-quit, and then restart the app.\n\n- Use of Onion Browser is at your own risk; remember that sensitive data does not always belong on a mobile device.\n\n** Onion Browser is free and open-source software.

"description":"Purple Onion is a free browser that empowers you to use the internet more securely.  Purple Onion uses Tor to encrypt your Internet traffic and then hides it by bouncing through a series of computers around the world. Tor is free software and an open network that helps you defend against a form of network surveillance that threatens personal freedom and privacy, confidential business activities and relationships, and state security known as traffic analysis.  Purple Onion is the only app that creates a truly private internet connection. \n\nACCEPT NO SUBSTITUTES: Purple Onion is the safest way to use the Internet - Period.  Purple Onion bounces your encrypted traffic several times through computers around the world, instead of connecting you directly like VPNs and proxies. This process takes a little longer, but the strongest privacy and identity protection available is worth the wait.\n\nPRIVATE WEB SURFING:  Purple Onion is the most anonymous way to access any website, even if it’s normally blocked, monitored, or on the hidden web. \n\nPRIVACY FOR EVERYONE: Tor can help you confidentially research a competitor, get around someone blocking your favorite site, or circumvent a firewall to watch sports at work.\n\n***We Love Feedback***\nMESSAGE US: Are we missing your favorite feature? Found an annoying bug? We’d love to hear from you! Send us an email. \n jcltravels@gmail.com\n\nImportant Notes:\n- Web browsing/downloading through the anonymization network will be SIGNIFICANTLY SLOWER than through a non-tunneled browser like Safari. This is necessary and a small price to pay to keep your identity protected.\n- This product uses the Tor distributed networks is produced independently from the Tor(r) anonymity software and carries no guarantee from The Tor Project about quality, suitability or anything else.", "bundleId":"com.jcltravels.Firefox", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2019-02-08T16:18:32Z", "trackName":"Purple Onion - TOR Browser VPN", "averageUserRating":4.0, "userRatingCount":5},
