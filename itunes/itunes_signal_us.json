"description":"OpenSignal is the ultimate signal toolkit that shows you how to get a better network connection instantly, find nearby free Wifi hotspots worldwide, view signal maps so that you can compare performance of networks in your area and test the speed of your mobile or Wifi connection.\n\nUnlike other apps, which look for maximum possible speed through optimised testing, OpenSignal informs you about your true speed - what you are likely to experience when normally using your phone. Anyone using the app contributes data, informing others about real-world, not estimated, mobile performance (and we'll never ask you for personal information, just your signal strength stats).\n\nWith OpenSignal you can map cellular coverage, find Wi-Fi hotspots, test and improve your reception & get faster data.\n\n- Signal compass points you in the direction your signal is coming from \n- Speed test for download, upload and latency\n- Map of cell towers and Wifi hotspots\n- Coverage maps allow you see the best/worst places for 2G, 3G and 4G \n- Free and ad-free\n\nBased on our community-generated data we are able to help keep you better connected by giving you a practical solution to the problems of slow mobile internet. Simply follow our signal compass to walk towards better phone signal or see our in-app coverage maps to work out which carrier is best for where you are, useful if you're thinking about switching networks. Our wifi maps help you find local public-access wireless networks (Wifi hotspots).\n\nMaps are not updated in real-time. Don’t worry though, we log the information you share with us to improve our coverage maps and performance information. We’re working hard to make sure the data you contribute to the project is available to everyone as quickly as possible. \n\nTips:\n- Not all towers and wireless hotspots are in our database - we’re working on it!\n- Moving in the direction of your cell tower (the signal compass) will not always improve reception due to interference effects/local geography\n- Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nIf you read to here (!) you should really join the OpenSignal beta to help us improve the app, just email hi@opensignal.com if you're interested.", "trackName":"OpenSignal - Speed Test & Maps", "bundleId":"com.opensignal.OpenSignalMaps", "genreIds":["6002", "6007"], "averageUserRating":3.0, "userRatingCount":557},

"description":"Confide is your confidential messenger. With end-to-end encrypted, self-destructing, and screenshot-proof messages, Confide gives you the comfort of knowing that your private communication will now truly stay that way.\n\n• Messages are end-to-end encrypted\n• Messages disappear forever once they are read\n• Screenshot-proof messages with our patent-pending ScreenShield technology\n• Send text, photos, videos, documents and voice messages\n• 1-to-1 and group messaging\n• Available for mobile, desktop, iMessage and Siri\n\nAlso available from Confide:\n\nConfide Plus — More features. More control.\n• Unlimited attachments\n• Retract (\"un-send\") an unread message\n• Nicknames\n• Themes\n• Priority customer support\n\nConfide has been used in over 180 countries and has been featured in Fortune, Forbes, Bloomberg, NYT, WSJ, Washington Post and more.\n\nConfide allows you to communicate digitally with the same level of privacy and security as the spoken word.\n\nGet Confide and retake control of your digital conversations.\n\n———\n\nScreenShield is a new technology that is only supported when the message recipient is using a recent version of Confide. But don’t worry, older versions of Confide are still screenshot-protected by our reading experience.\n\n———\n\nConfide for iMessage allows you to send and receive Confide messages entirely within iMessage. It’s completely frictionless – there’s no need to create an account. Due to technical limitations of iMessage, Confide for iMessage does not offer the same level of screenshot protection as the main version of Confide.\n\n———\n\nPrice may vary by location.

"description":"Our CoverageMap app empowers you to test network performance in areas where you live, work, and play. Not only does testing performance in your neighborhood provide you with useful insights, but the data you produce also helps carriers improve the quality of your mobile life.\n\nThe newest version of the app for iOS has expanded the functionality and ease of use found in previous versions to give you a personal network testing and comparison tool that’s better than ever. And whether you’re already familiar with our CoverageMap app or simply curious about testing mobile network performance in your neighborhood, you’ll quickly see how easy it is to get started.\n\nNew features:\n•\tImproved user interface. Our updated app not only boasts a beautiful new user interface, but it also makes it easy to find and select the options and settings you want to use before running a test. Plus, easily identify areas that have yet to be tested, and be the first to put yourself on the map. \n•\tA world of results on an expanded dashboard. Your test results can tell you a great deal about your daily mobile life. Get a broader understanding of your findings with new stats such as moving averages, histories, and more. \n•\tPersonalize your results. Wondering how performance with your carrier of choice compares between the office and at home? Now you can find out. Easily select multiple hexes on the map to compare your results, and find out if others are having the same experience. \n•\tTest how you want, when you want. Set your device to automatically run performance tests continuously, or sample network conditions in the background. Stop a test at any time with either setting. When you turn background collection on, you anonymously contribute information about your device’s data performance without using your data plan. \n•\tWe want to hear from you. While we love to see more and more data points appear on the map, you can also tell us about your experience in your own words. Whether it’s something you feel requires our attention, or you just want to say you’ve had a great experience testing performance, we want to hear from you.\n\nEnjoying the app?

You can connect to an existing Google account, create new accounts on public XMPP servers (including via Tor), or even connect to your own server for extra security.\n\nUnlike other apps that keep you stuck in their walled garden, ChatSecure is fully interoperable with other clients that support OTR and XMPP, such as Adium, Jitsi, and more.\n\nChatSecure only uses well-known open source cryptographic libraries to keep your conversations private. Other apps may make claims about 'military grade' security but, without publicly auditable source code and verifiable end-to-end encryption, you cannot be truly safe.\n\n* XMPP with TLS certificate pinning.\n* OTR for verifiable end-to-end encryption and forward secrecy.\n* OMEMO for a mobile-friendly alternative to OTR.\n* Tor integration for easy access to XMPP .onion services.\n* SQLCipher to locally encrypt conversation logs.\n* Free and Open Source: https://github.com/chatsecure/chatsecure-ios\n\nFollow @ChatSecure on Twitter: https://twitter.com/chatsecure\n\n►► ChatSecure Donations\nSubscribe to ChatSecure to help make developing free and open source privacy tools sustainable.

Every detail has been optimized in order to save you time. By comparison, ReachFast is 1 to 3 times faster than other contacts apps in any given scenario.\n\n\nFeatures:\n* Pull-down to search, instead of tapping on a specific area. You can open the search without even looking at the screen.\n* Only One tap to call.\n* Two taps to Facetime.\n* Swipe right to message.\n* Favorites and Recently called contacts appear INLINE with the contacts... No need to switch tabs and the landing happens always on the recent, if you don't find the contact there, just pull down to search.\n* Smart search, that learns who you call the most and gives you the first result as a top hit, while reducing the number of letters you type before finding your contact.\n* Adding a contact is super fast. we don't stop you to ask if you are adding to existing or updating a new one, it happens along the way and reduces 3 steps out of the overall scenario.\n* While adding a contact, no need to move your finger and look at the upper screen to switch fields, you can swipe the keyboard to jump lines while keeping your fingers on the keyboard to save you time.\n* Forgot their names? View your contacts Chronologically. \n* Ability to show pictures, organize by first name, sounds, vibration, show emails etc.", "trackName":"Swipe To iMessage or SMS - Tap to Call & Facetime - By ReachFast Contacts", "bundleId":"com.completure.com.contacts", "genreIds":["6007", "6002"], "averageUserRating":3.5, "userRatingCount":96},

"description":"ABOUT THIS COURSE\n\nThis course introduces signal processing tools currently used in geophysics. It has been elaborated both from the book \"Signal processing for geologists and geophysicists\" (J.L. Mari, F. Glangeaud, F. Coppens, 1999) and from the CD \"Signal processing in geosciences\" (F. Glangeaud ,J.L. Mari, 2000).\n\nFor signal processing specialists, it will be a source of how classical or new theories can be applied to field data.Teaching staff should find it provides a means of tackling the teaching signal processing techniques.\n\n- - -\n\nFOREWORD\n\nThis on line course presents a succession of lessons classed by theme. The different themes that are tackled are:\n\n• The Fourier Transformation\n• Common functions in spectral analysis\n• Sampling\n• Correlation\n• Wave separation\n• Seismic applications\n• The Hilbert transformation\n• Filtering\n• Near Surface Geophysics\n• Stochastic Signal Processing\n• Attributes\n\nEach theme has an introduction and a series of lessons which are associated with it. A lesson comprises of text, a video, a formulary, if judged necessary, and in some cases an applet to practice.\n\n• The text present has been voluntarily reduced; its objective is put across by the animation. This objective may be the presentation of a specific transform used in signal processing and applied in seismic processing. The term \"transform\" is used here in a very general sense. It covers at times the notion of transformation, such as the Fourier transformation or filters such as the Wiener filter. The objective perhaps being to show the application of a \"transform\" on simulated synthetic data or on real acquired geophysical data.\n\n• The video is an illustration of the text. It permits a visualization of the data, to study the influence of processing parameters on the data. The images were conceived in a manner which permits an immediate visual comparison and that enables an evaluation of the influence of a parameter change on the data processing. If an applet is associated with the video, some parameters can be modified by moving the cursors, the calculations taking place in real time.\n\n• The formulary gives the mathematical formula used in the animation. The reader is invited to use the book cited above as a reference for the notations used and the demonstrations. The formulary should be considered as a simple memory aid.\n\nThe videos and the applets have been created thanks to the MUSTIG software ( mustig.free.fr, Gérard Lejeune).\nIn this on line course, 20 lessons can be selected. For the animations based on field data measurement, the authors or organisms that provide with them are mentioned.\n\nThis on line course does not constitute a complete course in itself ; referral to the basic signal processing texts remains essential.\n\n- - -\n\nTHE AUTHOR\n\nJean-Luc Mari is at present a geophysics professor at IFP School and an IFPEN expert. He supervises the MSc research program in \"Lithosphere, Basins, Petroleum\" part of the Master's program in Science and Technology (Paris VI).\n\nJean-Luc Mari is a member of the European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers.\n\nJean-Luc Mari is author and co-author of patents (in the field of acoustic well logging), numerous scientific articles and books on geophysical methods and signal processing.\n\nHe has been involved in the design and development of specific teaching aids (on-line (http://www-ig.unil.ch/cours/) and CD-ROMs).\n\nHis main fields of expertise are seismic acquisition and processing, geophysics of reservoirs and civil engineering.", "trackName":"Signal Processing for geologists and geophysicists", "bundleId":"com.odysys.signalprocessing", "genreIds":["6017", "6018"]},

"description":"SPL Meter is a professional-grade sound level meter, also known as a decibel or dB meter, for your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nModeled after a traditional analog SPL meter, we have faithfully reproduced all the characteristics and qualities found in those meters, including the ballistics, ranges, filters, and decay rates.\n\nUnder the hood we have advanced DSP-based algorithms that meet or exceed ANSI / IEC Type 1 standards. And starting with iOS 6, we can disable the mic filters and limiters, to get the real world performance of a hand-held SPL meter.\n\nAnd now, upgrade SPL Meter with iTestMic, our pro-grade test & measurement mic, made specifically for iOS devices. Using iTestMic with SPL Meter, you get a calibrated, accurate SPL Meter, that meets industry standards for Type 2 performance. See our website for more information.\n\nBut don't compare us to a Radio Shack meter, ours is much more accurate! \n\nWe have also included a digital LCD display, as shown in the image, to make this the best SPL meter available for iPhone or iPad. And this is something that the old analog meters never had! \n\nThe screen will flip when you flip the phone over, so that you can point the iPhone mic directly at the sound source. (iPhone X does not support upside down mode)\n\nSPL Meter is a universal app -- buy once, and use on all of your iOS devices.\n\nSPL Meter is built by the same team that created the other great professional audio and acoustics apps on the store, Studio Six Digital.  Built on the engine of our more expensive \"SPL\" app, SPL Meter's filters and decay rates meet or exceed ANSI type 1. This app is not a toy or a game.\n\nSPL Meter is the one audio app that everyone who works in audio must have on their phone! Not only have we made the best one, but we've priced it so you can't afford not to get it.\n\n*** FEATURES:\n\nFILTERS -- A and C weighting filters are provided.\n\nDECAY -- Choose ANSI Fast or Slow.\n\nRANGES -- 40dB to 120dB in 9 ranges.\n\nCALIBRATION -- Comes pre-calibrated for the typical iPhone or iPad built-in and headset mic, but you can adjust the calibration if you have a professional, calibrated meter to compare it to. Accesses our cloud-based iOS device calibration database, which we updates as new devices are released.\n\nINTERNAL / EXTERNAL MIC -- Select Internal to activate the included compensation filter, which is designed to flatten the frequency response of the built-in or headset mic. External will work with our iPhone Measurement Mic, to be released later this summer. See our website for more details.\n\nSPL Meter is bargain-priced to make it easy for anyone to check out one of our professional, accurate apps. Studio Six Digital is dedicated to making the iPhone and Touch a professional audio and acoustics test device.\n\nCheck out our full line of professional-grade audio and acoustics apps: SPL, the professional digital iPhone sound level meter, SPL Graph, for recording SPL over time, RTA, a 1/3 octave real-time analyzer,  FFT, for detailed acoustic analysis, ETC, the energy-time curve function, RT60, for automated octave-band decay time measurement, Speaker Pop, to test speaker polarity, and Generator, the iPhone signal generator.\n\nAlso, if you are looking for more great acoustical and audio test apps, have a look at AudioTools, our premier app for audio professionals.", "trackName":"SPL Meter", "bundleId":"com.studiosix.SPLMeter", "genreIds":["6011", "6002"], "averageUserRating":3.5, "userRatingCount":458},

"description":"A background running, multitasking enabled app, that alerts you to loss of cell / wifi service!\n\nNew! Now supports EMAIL of the full data logging of loss of cell service. A full color map showing pins where each location of no cell service occurred. You can now email yourself (or anyone) a complete log sorted by date (with Carrier name) of the long/lat data and time of cell service lost.\n\nNeed to know when you lose cell phone reception? Even if your phone is in your pocket or briefcase? This is the app!\n\nWorried about the reception issues you have read about? This app is always watching for loss of reception, even when you are not looking, and will alert you if it happens. A must for people who cannot afford to miss calls! Nurses, Doctors, Police, Firefighters, Moms and Dads: Never miss that important call again because you are in a dead spot with no cell service.\n\nNote: Known limitation: If you are connected to a known WiFi network, this app cannot detect the loss of 3G/4G/LTE while connected to WiFi, I am actively working on a solution to this. For a workaround, turn off WiFi if you absolutely need to know when the cellular signal drops out at all times.\n \nDon't ever miss an important call or SMS text message again, unaware that you have no cell service. Have Cell Guardian monitor for you - from the background!\n\n** New! Mute toggle for Wifi alerts and Battery Alerts per your feedback! thank you!\n\n** New! Now with AUDIBLE Low Battery Alerts. Warns you from the background with a pop up alert, plus sound, that your battery is below 50% and then below 30% and down to 5%: This is something the iPhone does not have built in, remember the older phones that would beep to warn you of low battery? now you can have that great feature back!**\n\n**No surprise bills in the mail!**\n\nLots of download apps for music and video can seamlessly go from your home Wi-Fi to a LTE network without a hiccup, thats great, but not so great if you have a capped data plan and have to pay for that LTE time! Let this app warn you when you leave Wi-Fi for LTE every-time. \n\nYou can easily test this app by turning Airplane mode on and off while the app is running, or by turning Wi-Fi on and off. You will see the pop up alerts.\n\nAnother fun way to test this: If you use Wi-Fi at home, walk around your block and see how far you can get before the app beeps to tell you you lost your Wi-Fi connection.\n\nIf you are not on iOS 4 or later yet, you can still use our \"No Signal\" app which runs on all versions of the OS (but does not run in background mode).\n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.", "trackName":"Signal Alert", "bundleId":"com.janus.", "genreIds":["6002", "6000"], "averageUserRating":3.5, "userRatingCount":27},

"description":"Signal Flags is an authority for identification, interpretation and use of signal flags between ships. This comprehensive app is your resource for signal flag information as specified by the International Code of Signals, the U.S. Navy, the International Sailing Federation, NATO, and Allied Forces around the world. Everything you need to know or want to know is in here.\n\n“I am a blue water sailor, cruising the East Coast of the U.S. and out to Bermuda. This app [contains] a copy of H.O. Pub 102 which is carried on the signal bridge of every commercial ship in the world. As the code meanings are uniform regardless of the nationality of the ship involved, a Portugese fisherman can use the code to request medical advice from the doctor onboard a Norwegian cruise ship even though neither speaks the other's language. Naturally, the paper copy is easier to use, but this is great in a pinch, and is a good study tool...”\n- GHK3\n\nIt's a beautiful day as you cruise the harbor in your new boat. The smell of sea water and being captain of your own vessel is pretty heady. Taking in the view, you notice a Naval ship flying unusual flags in the area you’re heading for. There’s an “A” flag, followed by a number 3 flag. You know that seafaring vessels have special signals but you don’t know what they mean. Whipping out your Signal Flags app, you quickly scroll, tapping the appropriate flags to discover that you must avoid the ship within 300 yards as they have divers in the water. You adjust your course a little to comply. Thank goodness you were able to find out before you intruded on the ship’s operation.\n\nSignal Flags have been used for communication between ships at sea since ancient times. They have evolved throughout history and now are uniformly mandated by the International Code of Signals. The flags remove the language barrier by indicating with symbols, many types of distress and information to all U.S. and Allied Forces around the globe. They are used by government, military and civilians traveling the world’s waterways.\n\nThe app contains all of the images, flags and pennants that you’ll need to know, along with detailed descriptions of their usage and meanings in international, military, and sail racing contexts. You don’t need a cumbersome book; you don’t even need an internet connection. Just pull out your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch and open Signal Flags. All the important information is contained right there in the application. Within a few seconds, you’ll know what that ship is telling you.\n\nIn addition to the signal details, this app supplies you with the complete documentation of the NIMA pub. 102 and the U.S. Department of Transportation/U.S. Coast Guard Navigation Rules (COMDTINST M16672.2D).  Both documents include extensive in-document hyperlinks for accessibility along with a specialized toolbar for quick and simple browsing.  A specialized quiz function is also provided to aid in memorization of the entire flag set. \n\n\u2028Features:\n\n* Designed and developed by a U.S. Naval Academy graduate\n* Needs no network connection once downloaded\n* Contains all current signal flag details\n* Contains complete documentation as laid out by governing sources\n* Includes a quiz function to help you memorize all the flags\n\nIf you spend time on the open water, are the employee of an organization that navigates the seas, a yacht racer, or an interested student, this application is an indispensable tool. Everything is here for you, at your fingertips, anytime, anywhere.

"description":"\"I use this for analog, and audio measurements. Attach an Apple USB adapter and a $40 stereo A-D converter available online, and my iPad is like a $300 O'Scope.\" -thymeout-\n\nOscilloscope app is great for analyzing audio range signals, or learning oscilloscope measurement basics. The interface includes many standard oscilloscope controls, such as: triggering, time and voltage per division, signal measurement cursors, and more.\n\nThe app incorporates a signal (function) generator capable of generating sine, square, triangle, and sawtooth waveforms of up to 22 KHz. Calibration to an external reference signal is supported, guaranteeing the accuracy of measurements. \n\nInput can be acquired via the built-in microphone or an external mic/probe connected to the headset connector. For best results, use an external audio interface connected to your device dock. This allows for standard audio equipment to be connected, as well as for dual channel input. Oscilloscope probes also be connected (using a BNC connector). When feeding external signals via probes, you should take care not to exceed 1V AC voltage. Currently iDevices support only AC input. \n\nFor up-to-date information on feeding signals and currently supported audio interfaces, please visit http://oa.onyx3.com\n \n\nFeature Highlights: \n● Real-time waveform display (60 FPS) \n● Triggering modes: Normal, Auto, Single \n● Set trigger level and pre-trigger time \n● Dual channel signal generator \n● Reference signal calibration \n● Pause function to get a screen capture \n● Export traces as text file for further analysis\n● Measure signal data using cursors \n● Use \"finger pinch\" on screen to set voltage and time base \n● Double tap screen to enter Black Panel mode \n● Three color themes to choose from \n● XY mode for viewing Lissajous figures \n● Frequency range 20Hz-22KHz \n● iPhone X ready", "trackName":"Oscilloscope", "bundleId":"com.onyx3.oscilloscope", "genreIds":["6011", "6002"], "averageUserRating":4.0, "userRatingCount":39},

"description":"Generate custom color noises including brown, pink, white, blue, and violet.  Customize noise further by using low and high cut filters. Simple modern interface remembers all settings for quick generation and utilizes advanced mathematical formulas to generate all audio waves.  There are no audio files included in the application binary which keeps app size to a minimum and app performance to a maximum.\n\nWhat are benefits of listening to white noise?\n- Helps you sleep by blocking distractions\n- Pacifies fussy and crying babies\n- Relaxes and reduces stress\n- Increases focus while enhancing privacy\n- Soothes headaches and migraines\n- Masks tinnitus (ringing of the ears)\n\nWhat are the different sound colors?\n- White noise sounds similar to static of an analog TV or radio station that has stopped broadcasting.   White noise has equal energy across all sound frequencies.\n- Brown noise sounds like a powerful waterfall.  It has more energy at the lower frequencies and if you have a good speaker system with a subwoofer you should be able to really feel it.\n- Pink noise's upper sound frequencies don't fall off as fast as they do with brown noise, so you'll get a little more punch. The most interesting thing about pink noise is it's found in almost all electronic devices (known as flicker noise) and even in biological systems.\n- Blue and violet noise are the opposites of pink and brown noise, respectively, and sound like spraying water from a garden hose. It has more energy at the higher frequencies which means more treble and less bass. \n- Curious to learn more about color noises?  Check out this article for all the details:  http://www.tmsoft.com/white-noise-player/\n\nDirections:\nDrag the Sound Color slider to select brown, pink, white, blue, violet, or somewhere in-between.  Next, drag the low and high cut filters to further customize to your liking.  Adjust device volume using the on-screen volume slider to a comfortable level.  You can also specify to play audio to any AirPlay supported device.  Toggle audio playback using the Play/Pause button.\n\nCreated by the audio experts at TMSOFT that brought you the famous White Noise app.  Check out all our apps and sounds at http://www.tmsoft.com/", "trackName":"Noise Generator: Full Spectrum", "bundleId":"com.tmsoft.NoiseGenerator", "genreIds":["6002", "6020"], "averageUserRating":4.5, "userRatingCount":179},

"description":"A Real Time Analyzer for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. Test your speakers, tune your room, do acoustical analysis work or just have a better understanding of audio frequencies. RTA is a professional-grade acoustical analysis tool. All filters meet or exceed ANSI and IEC Class 1 specifications. \n\nIncludes Octave and 1/3 Octave modes, with selectable decay times, as well as Peak Hold and true linear Average mode.\n\n*** iOS Microphones\n\nWe have analyzied every iOS device, including all of the iPads, all iPhones, and iPod touches, and have created microphone compensation files that are applied automatically. You can trust the results you are getting, often within just a few dB of a far more expensive analyzer. Calibration is updated regularly, automatically, from our cloud-based calibration database.\n\nUpgrade to our iTestMic or iAudioInterface2 to bring your system up to full professional specs.\n\n*** Save and Recall Graphs\n\nYou can save and recall graphs, marked with the GPS location, date & time, and your comment, as well as store the image to your photo roll.\n\nExport the data as an XLS formatted file to your computer for inclusion in reports or further analysis.\n\n*** Max and Min Bars\n\nYou can also turn on resettable Max/Min bars (see image #4) to capture peaks. Double-tap to reset the bars.\n\n*** Specifications and Devices\n\nThe internal iPhone mic has a noise floor near 30 dB, and if your are running iOS 6, clips around 120 dB. \n\n*** Touch GUI\n\nFully interactive touch GUI features includes scroll up/down, pinch to zoom or compress the vertical dB scale, or swipe horizontally to get a cursor that reads out the exact dB level and frequency across the screen. To make the cursor disappear, swipe it off the graph to the left.\n\nThe landscape-mode display flips 180 degrees so that you can face the internal mic in either direction.\n\n*** Overlay Curves\n\nAlso included are optional noise curve overlays, in NCB, RC, PNC, NC, X-Curve and NR mode. See picture #2 for an example. Use this feature to get a quick reading on the noise levels in a room. Also includes the cinema large-room X-curve overlay.\n\n*** Calibration\n\nRTA can be fully calibrated, whether you are using it with the internal iOS microphone, or one of our professional test & measurement mic solutions. And, if you are using iTestMic, the mic calibration is transmitted directly to the app, so you are always calibrated.\n\n*** RTA or FFT?\n\nIf you are wondering if you should download this app or our FFT app, check out our website, we have a page devoted to this topic.\n\nSee our other acoustics and audio apps, including AudioTools.", "trackName":"RTA", "bundleId":"com.studiosix.RTA", "genreIds":["6011", "6002"], "averageUserRating":4.0, "userRatingCount":127}]
