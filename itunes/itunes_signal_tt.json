"description":"OpenSignal is the ultimate signal toolkit that shows you how to get a better network connection instantly, find nearby free Wifi hotspots worldwide, view signal maps so that you can compare performance of networks in your area and test the speed of your mobile or Wifi connection. \n\nUnlike other apps, which look for maximum possible speed through optimized testing, OpenSignal informs you about your true speed - what you are likely to experience when normally using your phone. Anyone using the app contributes data, informing others about real-world, not estimated, mobile performance (and we'll never ask you for personal information, just your signal strength stats).\n\nWith OpenSignal you can map cellular coverage, find Wi-Fi hotspots, test and improve your reception & get faster data.\n\n- Signal compass points you in the direction your signal is coming from \n- Speed test for download, upload and latency\n- Map of cell towers and Wifi hotspots\n- Coverage maps allow you see the best/worst places for 2G, 3G and 4G \n- Free and ad-free\n\nBased on our community-generated data we are able to help keep you better connected by giving you a practical solution to the problems of slow mobile internet. Simply follow our signal compass to walk towards better phone signal or see our in-app copoverage maps to work out which carrier is best for where you are, useful if you're thinking about switching networks. Our wifi maps help you find local public-access wireless networks (Wifi hotspots).\n\nMaps are not updated in real-time. Don’t worry though, we log the information you share with us to improve our coverage maps and performance information. We’re working hard to make sure the data you contribute to the project is available to everyone as quickly as possible. \n\nTips:\n- Not all towers and wireless hotspots are in our database - we’re working on it!\n- Moving in the direction of your cell tower (the signal compass) will not always improve reception due to interference effects/local geography\n- Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nIf you read to here (!) you should really join the OpenSignal beta to help us improve the app, just email hi@opensignal.com if you're interested.", "bundleId":"com.opensignal.OpenSignalMaps", "releaseDate":"2013-04-18T13:26:15Z", "primaryGenreName":"Utilities", "primaryGenreId":6002, "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2018-07-07T12:29:04Z"},

It’s completely frictionless – there’s no need to create an account. Due to technical limitations of iMessage, Confide for iMessage does not offer the same level of screenshot protection as the main version of Confide.\n\n———\n\nPrice may vary by location.

"description":"ABOUT THIS COURSE\n\nThis course introduces signal processing tools currently used in geophysics. It has been elaborated both from the book \"Signal processing for geologists and geophysicists\" (J.L. Mari, F. Glangeaud, F. Coppens, 1999) and from the CD \"Signal processing in geosciences\" (F. Glangeaud ,J.L. Mari, 2000).\n\nFor signal processing specialists, it will be a source of how classical or new theories can be applied to field data.Teaching staff should find it provides a means of tackling the teaching signal processing techniques.\n\n- - -\n\nFOREWORD\n\nThis on line course presents a succession of lessons classed by theme. The different themes that are tackled are:\n\n• The Fourier Transformation\n• Common functions in spectral analysis\n• Sampling\n• Correlation\n• Wave separation\n• Seismic applications\n• The Hilbert transformation\n• Filtering\n• Near Surface Geophysics\n• Stochastic Signal Processing\n• Attributes\n\nEach theme has an introduction and a series of lessons which are associated with it. A lesson comprises of text, a video, a formulary, if judged necessary, and in some cases an applet to practice.\n\n• The text present has been voluntarily reduced; its objective is put across by the animation. This objective may be the presentation of a specific transform used in signal processing and applied in seismic processing. The term \"transform\" is used here in a very general sense. It covers at times the notion of transformation, such as the Fourier transformation or filters such as the Wiener filter. The objective perhaps being to show the application of a \"transform\" on simulated synthetic data or on real acquired geophysical data.\n\n• The video is an illustration of the text. It permits a visualization of the data, to study the influence of processing parameters on the data. The images were conceived in a manner which permits an immediate visual comparison and that enables an evaluation of the influence of a parameter change on the data processing. If an applet is associated with the video, some parameters can be modified by moving the cursors, the calculations taking place in real time.\n\n• The formulary gives the mathematical formula used in the animation. The reader is invited to use the book cited above as a reference for the notations used and the demonstrations. The formulary should be considered as a simple memory aid.\n\nThe videos and the applets have been created thanks to the MUSTIG software ( mustig.free.fr, Gérard Lejeune).\nIn this on line course, 20 lessons can be selected. For the animations based on field data measurement, the authors or organisms that provide with them are mentioned.\n\nThis on line course does not constitute a complete course in itself ; referral to the basic signal processing texts remains essential.\n\n- - -\n\nTHE AUTHOR\n\nJean-Luc Mari is at present a geophysics professor at IFP School and an IFPEN expert. He supervises the MSc research program in \"Lithosphere, Basins, Petroleum\" part of the Master's program in Science and Technology (Paris VI).\n\nJean-Luc Mari is a member of the European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers.\n\nJean-Luc Mari is author and co-author of patents (in the field of acoustic well logging), numerous scientific articles and books on geophysical methods and signal processing.\n\nHe has been involved in the design and development of specific teaching aids (on-line (http://www-ig.unil.ch/cours/) and CD-ROMs).\n\nHis main fields of expertise are seismic acquisition and processing, geophysics of reservoirs and civil engineering.", "bundleId":"com.odysys.signalprocessing", "releaseDate":"2012-03-19T21:17:07Z", "primaryGenreName":"Education", "primaryGenreId":6017, "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2016-09-19T01:14:06Z"},

"description":"The Parabolic Stop and Reverse (SAR) is a simple technical indicator created by Welles Wilder. This trend following indicator is based on the idea that a strong trend will continue to increase in strength over time, following a parabolic arc. It uses a combination of price and time components to generate buy and sell signals. \n\nThe parabolic SAR is typically shown on the charts as a series of small 'dots' that are placed either above or below the price. When the price is trending to the upside, the dots are below the price action and when the price is trending to the downside, the dots are above the price action. It trails the price movement until the price move has finished and begins to reverse.\n\nA BUY signal is generated when the Parabolic SAR moves from being above price to below price and likewise a SELL signal is generated when the Parabolic SAR moves from being below price to above price. The Parabolic SAR is designed to be used in trending markets, and can lead to many false signals in sideways or choppy markets. As such, we are using ADX (Average Directional Index) indicator to filter off signals generated during a ranging market.\n\nLike any other indicators, Easy PSAR should not be used as a standalone indicator for making your trade decision but as a reference to spot potential trade opportunity.\n\nEasy PSAR provides a comprehensive dashboard that allows you to view the BUY/SELL signals on many popular instruments and across multiple timeframes (M5, M15, M30, H1, H4, D1) at one glance. (Please note that M5 is only available for viewing as an optional in-app subscription) In this way, you do not miss out any trading opportunities even on the go.\n\nBelow are some of the key features of the app.\n- Timely display of BUY/SELL signals from the parabolic SAR strategy on many popular instruments across multiple timeframes,\n- Timely push notification alert when BUY/SELL signals are generated based on your favourite instruments on your watchlist,\n- Display headline news of your favourite instruments\n\nIf you choose to subscribe to our Basic/Deluxe plan, payment will be charged to your iTunes account, and your account will be charged for renewal 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.

"description":"Our CoverageMap app empowers you to test network performance in areas where you live, work, and play. Not only does testing performance in your neighborhood provide you with useful insights, but the data you produce also helps carriers improve the quality of your mobile life.\n\nThe newest version of the app for iOS has expanded the functionality and ease of use found in previous versions to give you a personal network testing and comparison tool that’s better than ever. And whether you’re already familiar with our CoverageMap app or simply curious about testing mobile network performance in your neighborhood, you’ll quickly see how easy it is to get started.\n\nNew features:\n•\tImproved user interface. Our updated app not only boasts a beautiful new user interface, but it also makes it easy to find and select the options and settings you want to use before running a test. Plus, easily identify areas that have yet to be tested, and be the first to put yourself on the map. \n•\tA world of results on an expanded dashboard. Your test results can tell you a great deal about your daily mobile life. Get a broader understanding of your findings with new stats such as moving averages, histories, and more. \n•\tPersonalize your results. Wondering how performance with your carrier of choice compares between the office and at home? Now you can find out. Easily select multiple hexes on the map to compare your results, and find out if others are having the same experience. \n•\tTest how you want, when you want. Set your device to automatically run performance tests continuously, or sample network conditions in the background. Stop a test at any time with either setting.

Every detail has been optimized in order to save you time. By comparison, ReachFast is 1 to 3 times faster than other contacts apps in any given scenario.\n\n\nFeatures:\n* Pull-down to search, instead of tapping on a specific area. You can open the search without even looking at the screen.\n* Only One tap to call.\n* Two taps to Facetime.\n* Swipe right to message.\n* Favorites and Recently called contacts appear INLINE with the contacts... No need to switch tabs and the landing happens always on the recent, if you don't find the contact there, just pull down to search.\n* Smart search, that learns who you call the most and gives you the first result as a top hit, while reducing the number of letters you type before finding your contact.\n* Adding a contact is super fast. we don't stop you to ask if you are adding to existing or updating a new one, it happens along the way and reduces 3 steps out of the overall scenario.\n* While adding a contact, no need to move your finger and look at the upper screen to switch fields, you can swipe the keyboard to jump lines while keeping your fingers on the keyboard to save you time.\n* Forgot their names? View your contacts Chronologically. \n* Ability to show pictures, organize by first name, sounds, vibration, show emails etc.", "bundleId":"com.completure.com.contacts", "releaseDate":"2013-04-22T20:42:54Z", "primaryGenreName":"Productivity", "primaryGenreId":6007, "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2014-02-19T05:34:20Z"},

"description":"ChatSecure is a free and open source messaging app that features OTR encryption over XMPP. You can connect to an existing Google account, create new accounts on public XMPP servers (including via Tor), or even connect to your own server for extra security.\n\nUnlike other apps that keep you stuck in their walled garden, ChatSecure is fully interoperable with other clients that support OTR and XMPP, such as Adium, Jitsi, and more.\n\nChatSecure only uses well-known open source cryptographic libraries to keep your conversations private. Other apps may make claims about 'military grade' security but, without publicly auditable source code and verifiable end-to-end encryption, you cannot be truly safe.\n\n* XMPP with TLS certificate pinning.\n* OTR for verifiable end-to-end encryption and forward secrecy.\n* OMEMO for a mobile-friendly alternative to OTR.\n* Tor integration for easy access to XMPP .onion services.\n* SQLCipher to locally encrypt conversation logs.\n* Free and Open Source: https://github.com/chatsecure/chatsecure-ios\n\nFollow @ChatSecure on Twitter: https://twitter.com/chatsecure\n\n►► ChatSecure Donations\nSubscribe to ChatSecure to help make developing free and open source privacy tools sustainable.

The International Morse Code encodes the Roman alphabet, the Arabic numerals and a small set of punctuation and procedural signals as standardized sequences of short and long signals called \"dots\" and \"dashes\" respectively, or \"dits\" and \"dahs\".\n\nMore information with Morse code translation table can be found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code", "bundleId":"sk.mediaware.morsecode", "releaseDate":"2011-09-16T01:39:01Z", "primaryGenreName":"Utilities", "primaryGenreId":6002, "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2014-04-07T21:37:32Z"},

"description":"A background running, multitasking enabled app, that alerts you to loss of cell / wifi service!\n\nNew! Now supports EMAIL of the full data logging of loss of cell service. A full color map showing pins where each location of no cell service occurred. You can now email yourself (or anyone) a complete log sorted by date (with Carrier name) of the long/lat data and time of cell service lost.\n\nNeed to know when you lose cell phone reception? Even if your phone is in your pocket or briefcase? This is the app!\n\nWorried about the reception issues you have read about? This app is always watching for loss of reception, even when you are not looking, and will alert you if it happens. A must for people who cannot afford to miss calls! Nurses, Doctors, Police, Firefighters, Moms and Dads: Never miss that important call again because you are in a dead spot with no cell service.\n\nNote: Known limitation: If you are connected to a known WiFi network, this app cannot detect the loss of 3G/4G/LTE while connected to WiFi, I am actively working on a solution to this. For a workaround, turn off WiFi if you absolutely need to know when the cellular signal drops out at all times.\n \nDon't ever miss an important call or SMS text message again, unaware that you have no cell service. Have Cell Guardian monitor for you - from the background!\n\n** New! Mute toggle for Wifi alerts and Battery Alerts per your feedback! thank you!\n\n** New! Now with AUDIBLE Low Battery Alerts. Warns you from the background with a pop up alert, plus sound, that your battery is below 50% and then below 30% and down to 5%: This is something the iPhone does not have built in, remember the older phones that would beep to warn you of low battery? now you can have that great feature back!**\n\n**No surprise bills in the mail!**\n\nLots of download apps for music and video can seamlessly go from your home Wi-Fi to a LTE network without a hiccup, thats great, but not so great if you have a capped data plan and have to pay for that LTE time! Let this app warn you when you leave Wi-Fi for LTE every-time. \n\nYou can easily test this app by turning Airplane mode on and off while the app is running, or by turning Wi-Fi on and off. You will see the pop up alerts.\n\nAnother fun way to test this: If you use Wi-Fi at home, walk around your block and see how far you can get before the app beeps to tell you you lost your Wi-Fi connection.\n\nIf you are not on iOS 4 or later yet, you can still use our \"No Signal\" app which runs on all versions of the OS (but does not run in background mode).\n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.", "bundleId":"com.janus.", "releaseDate":"2011-07-23T01:22:57Z", "primaryGenreName":"Utilities", "primaryGenreId":6002, "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2015-07-10T23:43:56Z"},

"description":"SPL Meter is a professional-grade sound level meter, also known as a decibel or dB meter, for your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nModeled after a traditional analog SPL meter, we have faithfully reproduced all the characteristics and qualities found in those meters, including the ballistics, ranges, filters, and decay rates.\n\nUnder the hood we have advanced DSP-based algorithms that meet or exceed ANSI / IEC Type 1 standards. And starting with iOS 6, we can disable the mic filters and limiters, to get the real world performance of a hand-held SPL meter.\n\nAnd now, upgrade SPL Meter with iTestMic, our pro-grade test & measurement mic, made specifically for iOS devices. Using iTestMic with SPL Meter, you get a calibrated, accurate SPL Meter, that meets industry standards for Type 2 performance. See our website for more information.\n\nBut don't compare us to a Radio Shack meter, ours is much more accurate! \n\nWe have also included a digital LCD display, as shown in the image, to make this the best SPL meter available for iPhone or iPad. And this is something that the old analog meters never had! \n\nThe screen will flip when you flip the phone over, so that you can point the iPhone mic directly at the sound source. (iPhone X does not support upside down mode)\n\nSPL Meter is a universal app -- buy once, and use on all of your iOS devices.\n\nSPL Meter is built by the same team that created the other great professional audio and acoustics apps on the store, Studio Six Digital.  Built on the engine of our more expensive \"SPL\" app, SPL Meter's filters and decay rates meet or exceed ANSI type 1. This app is not a toy or a game.\n\nSPL Meter is the one audio app that everyone who works in audio must have on their phone! Not only have we made the best one, but we've priced it so you can't afford not to get it.\n\n*** FEATURES:\n\nFILTERS -- A and C weighting filters are provided.\n\nDECAY -- Choose ANSI Fast or Slow.\n\nRANGES -- 40dB to 120dB in 9 ranges.\n\nCALIBRATION -- Comes pre-calibrated for the typical iPhone or iPad built-in and headset mic, but you can adjust the calibration if you have a professional, calibrated meter to compare it to. Accesses our cloud-based iOS device calibration database, which we updates as new devices are released.\n\nINTERNAL / EXTERNAL MIC -- Select Internal to activate the included compensation filter, which is designed to flatten the frequency response of the built-in or headset mic. External will work with our iPhone Measurement Mic, to be released later this summer. See our website for more details.\n\nSPL Meter is bargain-priced to make it easy for anyone to check out one of our professional, accurate apps. Studio Six Digital is dedicated to making the iPhone and Touch a professional audio and acoustics test device.\n\nCheck out our full line of professional-grade audio and acoustics apps: SPL, the professional digital iPhone sound level meter, SPL Graph, for recording SPL over time, RTA, a 1/3 octave real-time analyzer,  FFT, for detailed acoustic analysis, ETC, the energy-time curve function, RT60, for automated octave-band decay time measurement, Speaker Pop, to test speaker polarity, and Generator, the iPhone signal generator.\n\nAlso, if you are looking for more great acoustical and audio test apps, have a look at AudioTools, our premier app for audio professionals.", "bundleId":"com.studiosix.SPLMeter", "releaseDate":"2011-07-22T02:13:02Z", "primaryGenreName":"Music", "primaryGenreId":6011, "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2018-07-09T20:48:37Z"},

"description":"Crude oil is a naturally-occurring substance found in certain rock formations in the earth and can be considered the most important commodity in the world today. The product and its derivatives can be found in many application of modern life from transportation to plastics.\n\nCurrently, there are two major benchmarks for world oil prices, West Texas Intermediate (WTI for short) and Brent crude oil. Both are light, sweet crude oils although WTI is relatively sweeter and lighter than its European counterpart. As a result of this, WTI often trades at a premium, usually by just a few dollars a barrel. However, due to a Libyan crisis, which has decreased the supply of light, sweet crude in the European region, and a supply glut at the main storage facility of WTI in Oklahoma, the premium/discount situation has changed and now Brent is more expensive than WTI.\n\nThe recent slump in oil prices present a good investment opportunity.\n\nKey features of Easy Oil Tracker:\n\n- Keep a close watch of the latest oil price using an easy to read dashboard so as to know when is a good time to enter or exit the market.\n- News ticker displaying important news related to oil.\n- Keep yourself informed of the latest news related to oil by reading the list of headline news.\n- Receive notification when oil price moves more than 7%.\n- Share current WTI/Brent oil price with family and friends.\n- Quick access to the Economic Calendar from Forex Factory.\n- Technical analysis of the prices.

"description":"Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) which is developed by Gerald Appel in the late seventies, is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of prices. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-day exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-day EMA. A nine-day EMA of the MACD is called the \"signal line\".\n\nThe two most popular strategies to generate buy/sell signals from MACD are as follow:\n\nCenter Line Crossover\n==============\n1. Potential BUY signal is generated when the 12-day EMA moves above the 26-day EMA.\n2. Potential SELL signal is generated when the 12-day EMA moves below the 26-day EMA.\n\nSignal Line Crossover\n===============\n1. Potential BUY signal is generated when the MACD turns up and crosses above the signal line.\n2. Potential SELL signal is generated when the MACD turns down and crosses below the signal line.\n\nEasy MACD Crossover provides a comprehensive dashboard that allows you to view the BUY/SELL signals from two of the most popular and effective strategies on many popular instruments and across multiple timeframes (M5, M15, M30, H1, H4, D1) at one glance. (Please note that M5 is only available for viewing as an optional in-app subscription) In this way, you do not miss out any trading opportunities even on the go.\n\nBelow are some of the key features of the app.\n\n- Timely display of BUY/SELL signals from two of the most popular and effective strategies on many popular instruments across multiple timeframes,\n- Timely push notification alert when BUY/SELL signals are generated based on your favourite instruments on your watch list,\n- Display headline news of your favourite instruments\n\nEasy Indicators relies on your support to fund its development and server costs.

"description":"The Momentum indicator is a simple yet useful indicator that compares where the current price is in relation to where the price was in the past. If the current price is higher than the price in the past, then the Momentum indicator is positive. In contrast, when the current price is lower than the price in the past, then the Momentum indicator is negative.\n\nEasy Momentum Crossover uses the Momentum indicator to generate potential trade signals. Potential BUY signal is generated when the Momentum indicator crosses above the zero line. This may imply that the price of the instrument has bottomed out and is reversing or by breaking out above recent highs, either way, these events are often interpreted by traders as bullish signals. Potential SELL signal is generated when the Momentum indicator crosses below the zero line. This may imply that the price of the instrument has topped out and is reversing or that the price has broken below recent lows, either way, these events are often interpreted by traders as bearish signals.\n\nLike any other indicators, Easy Momentum Crossover should not be used as a standalone indicator for determining buy / sell signal but as a reference to spot potential trade opportunity.\n\nEasy Momentum Crossover provides a comprehensive dashboard that allows you to view the BUY/SELL signals from the Momentum crossover strategy on many popular instruments and across multiple timeframes (M5, M15, M30, H1, H4, D1) at one glance. (Please note that M5 is only available for viewing as an optional in-app subscription) In this way, you do not miss out any trading opportunities even on the go.\n\nBelow are some of the key features of the app.\n- Timely display of BUY/SELL signals from the Momentum crossover strategy on many popular instruments across multiple timeframes,\n- Timely push notification alert when BUY/SELL signals are generated based on your favourite instruments on your watchlist,\n- Display headline news of your favourite instruments\n\nIf you choose to subscribe to our Basic/Deluxe plan, payment will be charged to your iTunes account, and your account will be charged for renewal 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.

"description":"Signal Flags is an authority for identification, interpretation and use of signal flags between ships. This comprehensive app is your resource for signal flag information as specified by the International Code of Signals, the U.S. Navy, the International Sailing Federation, NATO, and Allied Forces around the world. Everything you need to know or want to know is in here.\n\n“I am a blue water sailor, cruising the East Coast of the U.S. and out to Bermuda. This app [contains] a copy of H.O. Pub 102 which is carried on the signal bridge of every commercial ship in the world. As the code meanings are uniform regardless of the nationality of the ship involved, a Portugese fisherman can use the code to request medical advice from the doctor onboard a Norwegian cruise ship even though neither speaks the other's language. Naturally, the paper copy is easier to use, but this is great in a pinch, and is a good study tool...”\n- GHK3\n\nIt's a beautiful day as you cruise the harbor in your new boat. The smell of sea water and being captain of your own vessel is pretty heady. Taking in the view, you notice a Naval ship flying unusual flags in the area you’re heading for. There’s an “A” flag, followed by a number 3 flag. You know that seafaring vessels have special signals but you don’t know what they mean. Whipping out your Signal Flags app, you quickly scroll, tapping the appropriate flags to discover that you must avoid the ship within 300 yards as they have divers in the water. You adjust your course a little to comply. Thank goodness you were able to find out before you intruded on the ship’s operation.\n\nSignal Flags have been used for communication between ships at sea since ancient times. They have evolved throughout history and now are uniformly mandated by the International Code of Signals. The flags remove the language barrier by indicating with symbols, many types of distress and information to all U.S. and Allied Forces around the globe. They are used by government, military and civilians traveling the world’s waterways.\n\nThe app contains all of the images, flags and pennants that you’ll need to know, along with detailed descriptions of their usage and meanings in international, military, and sail racing contexts. You don’t need a cumbersome book; you don’t even need an internet connection. Just pull out your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch and open Signal Flags. All the important information is contained right there in the application. Within a few seconds, you’ll know what that ship is telling you.\n\nIn addition to the signal details, this app supplies you with the complete documentation of the NIMA pub. 102 and the U.S. Department of Transportation/U.S. Coast Guard Navigation Rules (COMDTINST M16672.2D).  Both documents include extensive in-document hyperlinks for accessibility along with a specialized toolbar for quick and simple browsing.  A specialized quiz function is also provided to aid in memorization of the entire flag set. \n\n\u2028Features:\n\n* Designed and developed by a U.S. Naval Academy graduate\n* Needs no network connection once downloaded\n* Contains all current signal flag details\n* Contains complete documentation as laid out by governing sources\n* Includes a quiz function to help you memorize all the flags\n\nIf you spend time on the open water, are the employee of an organization that navigates the seas, a yacht racer, or an interested student, this application is an indispensable tool. Everything is here for you, at your fingertips, anytime, anywhere.

"description":"Signal Flags Communicator enables a unique form of communication using flag images.  It is both a training aid to those wanting to learn to recognize the flags of the International Code of Signals, and an app to support and ensure privacy of communications, immediately, for anyone, with or without knowledge of the flags.\n\nIn operation, Signal Flags Communicator instantly translates written or spoken (via Siri) text into corresponding flag images, constructs a graphic representation of the text, and a proprietary FlagMessage file.  Once the composition is complete,  the graphic (PDF) image can be sent via email or text, and is printable on any AirPrint capable printer.  The FlagMessage file, which is simultaneously created, is intended for peer-to-peer communications via AirDrop or email attachment.  Recipients of the FlagMessage file, as peers,  can use their own Signal Flags Communicator app to translate and interpret the message when received, and save it locally on their device.  Since neither the PDF nor the FlagMessage file contain any scannable text, the communication is resistant to any text scanning by 3rd parties.  When transmitted via AirDrop, communications are secure and directly from one device to another, with no 3rd party involvement.\n\nFeatures include:\n• composing, printing, and sending of flag images and message content via email, text and AirDrop \n• A “native” app; all data is self contained in a protected form on the device\n• can communicate securely peer-to-peer via AirDrop\n• email capability uses a text-free proprietary format that cannot be scanned for text by 3rd parties\n• text messaging support for transmission of flag image content via a text-free PDF file \n• AirPrint support for printing flag images on all capable printers, including roll printers\n• recipients without knowledge or access to the flags can read the messages via use of the app on their own device\n• includes all International Code, and USN/NATO flags and pennants\n• capability to setup a message book, searchable for message text or meaning", "bundleId":"com.gigs.Signal-Flags-Communicator", "releaseDate":"2014-09-07T01:06:12Z", "primaryGenreName":"Social Networking", "primaryGenreId":6005, "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2016-04-25T20:35:49Z"},

Then, simply put your iPhone, iPad, or iPod to sleep by pressing the button no the top.\n\nIt's that easy.\n\nYou can rest assured (literally) that you'll be on time for that final exam or business flight because Crazy Alarm Clock will send you 5 timed alerts, a minute apart. Just to warn you, there is no \"Snooze\" button! We can't guarantee that you'll get restful sleep, but you WILL get out of bed.\n\nEven if you just need a simple daily signal or a safe, timed plan to keep dinner from getting charred, Crazy Alarm Clock is the key. Here's what you get:\n\n- Simplicity – Listen to the loud sounds, choose one, and set the alarm.\n- Easy Sorting – Select your favorite sounds or arrange alphabetically.\n- Cool Design – Check out the screenshots below.\n- Obnoxious Sounds – The air horn WILL wake you up!\n- Great Extras – Upgrade to get full access to all the crazy sounds.\n\nNobody wants to be the idiot who sleeps through college graduation.
