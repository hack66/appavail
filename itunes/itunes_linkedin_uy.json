"description":"Eight is the ultimate business card organizer and professional networking platform. Used by over 2 million people, Eight is an easy, convenient & completely free-to-use app.\n\nSimply scan in any visiting cards you receive, and see them instantly put into a digital business cards holder. Eight uses a proprietary combination of OCR technology & human input to accurately digitize each card into a unique Eight profile, giving users a convenient database of their professional network with 99.9% accuracy!\n\nEight is also a powerful professional network and enables you to network with scanned business cards on the app. From a contact's profile, you can call, email, or view their address on a map. Eight users can share news & updates with their Eight network or even interact with each other through instant messages. \n\nWhy Eight?\n-\tIt scans business cards with 99.9% accuracy using both OCR & human transcription thus helping users to manage contacts and stay linked in conveniently and easily.\n-\tThe standard version is free and includes scanning, organizing features. \n-\tUsers can purchase Eight Premium for quicker digitization and more benefits.\n-\tUsers can sync their networks to their devices. Data is also automatically updated if connected contacts change the details on their business card.\n\nWhat Eight has in store for you:\n\n- Organize business cards & professional networks: \nUsers often have a large stack of disorganized visiting cards & biz cards making them difficult to use and refer to. Eight is a free digital card holder that solves this problem by removing the need for manual entry. Now using your mobile cam, cards will be instantly digitized into an e visiting card, and you will be able to see full information of the card on the app. Additionally, once digitized, Eight lets users add notes & tags on profiles so they can manage contacts & organize their business & professional network efficiently. It's a digital card scanner, holder, reader & organizer consolidated in a single app.\n\n- Manual input to ensure superior accuracy: \nEight uses a combination of OCR technology & human resources to digitize business cards from a scanned image into a digital Eight profile. After users scan their biz cards, Eight uses OCR technology to instantly read the data on the visiting cards, which is then manually checked & corrected by our team, ensuring 99.9% accuracy even for the most hard-to-read cards. It's a perfect digital card maker as it easily converts visiting cards to e biz cards.\n\n- Easy search feature to find & reach contacts from within the app: \nThis is not your regular visiting cards scanner or digital business card holder. It allows users to manage contacts & contact them via email or phone, helping them unlock new business & career opportunities. It is especially helpful for salespeople and salesforce users to manage & convert leads.\n\n- Free to use basic app with an option to buy premium features: \nThe standard version of the app is free to use and has all the essential functions that make Eight a powerful business solution. Users can purchase Eight Premium for additional benefits including an ability to export their data (e.g. phonebook sync). It not only helps users to convert their visiting cards & biz cards into e business cards using OCR but also lets them export their e business card data to their devices.\n\n- Networking: Eight stands out among others as it not only scans your business cards but also lets you stay linked in with your contacts who are themselves Eight users, by providing options such as private instant chat messaging and an activity feed thus providing you with ample business opportunities and timely updates from your network.\n\nHow does Eight compare to alternatives?\nCamcard: Camcard and most other scanners only uses OCR, not human input, causing significantly lower accuracy.\nBric: Bric and others have scan limits, following which you have to pay. Eight is totally free and unlimited.", "bundleId":"net.8card.eight", 
"releaseNotes":"For everyone using Eight Premium, we're pleased to announce a new feature:\n\n-  You can now add photos in the notes section.\n\nWhether its a whiteboard captured from a meeting, or slides used in a seminar, you can add those photos to one of your contacts. Now you can recall the moment of exchanging business cards, visually!\n\nMore updates to come soon. Thanks for using Eight!", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2019-03-13T04:24:43Z", "genreIds":["6000", "6002"], "releaseDate":"2011-06-18T01:56:13Z", "primaryGenreName":"Business", "primaryGenreId":6000, "sellerName":"Sansan, Inc."},

"description":"SparksFly™ simplifies and unifies the repeated steps you take participating in all your social feeds. One app, one screen lets you view and post all user-content regardless of what social media platform is it on. You gain “intelligent control” over searching, sorting and curating all of your feeds - control to know something before others do, to know more than others do - control to be more well-informed all from what is already flowing through your social mobile apps. SparksFly™ brings people, brands, ideas and relevant real-time information closer together than ever before. \n\nSparksFly™ Patent-pending Artificial Intelligence \nWe took another GIANT leap forward in the evolution of social media by applying our multi-patent-pending AI Engine to all the content across your selected social networks within the SparksFly™ app. Our engine “discovers and surfaces” uniquely relevant pieces of content, facts, trends, places, people, topics and ideas, “Sparks”, that would have been impossible to discover on your own culling through thousands of posts across multiple social networks in real time. The more our AI engine learns about what you do, like and dislike in your feeds, the brighter and more frequent the “Sparks” fly. Sparks come from from the collection of content flowing through ALL of your feeds together NOT Twitter, or Facebook, or Instagram, etc. separately. \n\nSparksFly’s™ single screen and individualized AI engine enable anyone who uses more than one social network to keep up with ALL content and get ahead of its collective meaning. It's a MUST HAVE for those who use social to be in-the-know or want to be one of the first-to-know without the massive time commitment required today. \n\nSocial simplified. It's about time.\n\nGet the App Now!", "bundleId":"com.sparksfly.iphone", "releaseNotes":"Updated some API's.

"description":"This app beautifully displays quotes from all over the world to help you get motivation to work.You can choose to use the app simply as it is, or customize to your liking using more than ten features (most number of features for a quotes app). \nWe have been receiving great reviews, with an average of 4.7 stars.\n\n[List of functions]\n\n- Quote display\n- Favorites\n- Autoplay\n- Background and text design customization\n- Play only favorites\n- VoiceOver\n- Regular notification with your favorite quote\n- BGM\n- Snow animation\n- ... and many more (details below in [Function Details]!)\n\n[Function Details]\n\n- Quote display\n\nWe will deliver only the best quotes, carefully picked from around the world. Every time you press the switch in the Quotes page, a new inspirational quote appears.\nQuotes will be added regularly, and you don't have to update the app to get them. You could also switch between different languages at any point from the Settings page (left swipe from the Quotes page).\n\n- Favorites\n\nYou can \"favorite\" a quote by tapping the star icon in the Quotes page. \nYou can see your favorites list from the Settings page. You could also display only the favorites during Autoplay (when using Autoplay feature), or set a quote from your favorites list as a notification message.\n\n- Autoplay\n\nYou could let the app do the switching by tapping the triangle button on the Quotes page. If you feel tired of pressing the switch every time, please try this function. While the triangle icon is rotating, it is in Autoplay mode. You could end Autoplay mode by tapping anywhere on the screen. You could also change the time interval for Autoplay from the Settings page. Autoplay can be used at the same time as VoiceOver.\n\n- Background and text design customization\n\nSwipe to the right to go to the Design Settings page. You could change background image and text design to your liking. Go ahead and look for your favorite combination of background, text color, and text shadow color. \nTip: It tends to look good if you choose the same color for both text color and text shadow color.\nText size can be changed from the Settings page.\n\n- VoiceOver\n\nUnlike any other quotes app, we have VoiceOver function (reading the quotes out loud). This feature is compatible in Japanese and English.\nPlease do understand that it may sound mechanical at times. You could change the overall tone of the voice from the Settings page.\n\n- Regular notification\n\nGo to Settings -> xxx time -> \"choose message\" to register a message from your favorites list as a notification message. Use this to remind and motivate yourself each day.\n\n- BGM\n\nHow about reading inspirational quotes while listening to calm, natural background music? You can choose from three types of sounds from the nature from the Settings page. You could use this to relax before going to bed.\n\n- Snow animation\n\nAs a small gift to users, we prepared a snow animation. Go to the Settings page and turn the feature on, go back to the Quotes page, and let the sakura fall gently down your screen. True, it might block your view a little. But I think it is sometimes nice to feel the nature while reading inspirational quotes. \n\n- Share with friends\n\nTap the arrow icon on the Quotes page, to show a selection of media to share. Currently we have twitter, facebook and LINE. \nYou could also save the image to your camera roll. Turn on your friend's \"switch\" by sharing your favorite quote. \n\n- Finally\n\nThere are more features than what we have explained above, and we are certain that this app will satisfy any quote lover.\nWe are also doing regular updates to accommodate to the latest OS and features.

Or even just the person you met while you were out at dinner last night with that amazing job opportunity? Chances are, you have a pile of business cards that you’re afraid to throw away because there’s definitely a possibility that you might reach out to one of them for something. But what do you do with them in the meantime?\n\nNot to mention those times when you met that perfect business contact but you just realized you forgot to restock your own cards in your wallet! That cocktail napkin with your phone number will definitely hold up in their pocket. Right.\n\nWhy not just skip the entire process? Everything else is digital nowadays – shouldn’t one of the most obnoxious business trends finally evolve as well?\n\nSwoopMeet completely takes away the necessity to carry a business card.

This will destroy aliens which are connected together with a telepathic link. Alien telepathic link is connected when aliens touching others horizontally or vertically and their are coloured with a same colour. There are six different coloured alien orcs (red, blue, green, yellow, purple and oranges). So you have to plan your strikes well so you could make huge link between aliens. You have two rounds to make a strike before new wave is coming closer. If aliens reach the earth, it's end of mankind living on globe. You really need to grow your experience and intelligence to finally reach the victory of the battle.\n\nAre you ready on this battle and rescue world nations globally and protect our beautiful planet.
