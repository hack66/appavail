"description":"VPN + TOR is the only app featuring both a VPN and a TOR browser. VPN + TOR is the most secure and advanced browser that allows you to choose between the speed and ease of use of VPNs tunnel connection and the advanced protection offered by the TOR network.\n \nAre you sure none is spying on you? Nowadays, anonymous surfing on the web is increasingly important in order to protect your personal data 360 degrees. This is valid not only when you browse incognito from a laptop, but also when you use your iPhone and you want to shield your private informations. The TOR (The Onion Router) Network protects you by bouncing your communications around a distributed network of relays run by volunteers all around the world: it prevents somebody watching your Internet connection from learning what sites you visit, and it prevents the sites you visit from learning your physical location. Moreover, it's suitable for travellers who need to access different kind of contents from abroad.\n \nIf you use this application you will enjoy the following features for free:\n- Your Internet access will be tunnelled over the Tor network.\n- Websites will not see your real IP address, as when you use a proxy, and the traffic from your browser would look to be originated from another place. Moreover your connection is encrypted.\n- ISPs and insecure wireless networks won't see your browsing. It will be difficult for anybody to trace your internet activities back to your device.\n- You will be able to access .onion websites which are only accessible through the TOR network.\n- Advanced browsing capability with tabs, and popover detection and blocking.\n- You can automatically delete cookies, cache and third party data on application exit.\n- Support for audio and video playback.\n- Easy to use interface: just one button to connect to the closest server!\n\nIf you purchase our Premium subscription you will also be able to enjoy the following advanced features:\n- Ads-Free experience.\n- Unlimited VPN Session duration.\n- Priority Support.\n \nVPN + TOR is the allay for data safety you can trust. Download it now and secure your mobile browser: it's fast and easy, you just need to tap a button to enjoy full anonymity. Be untraceable wherever you are, choose unlimited privacy and security!\n\n-------------------\nSUBSCRIPTION INFO:\n\nSubscribe to take advantage of all the features described above.\n• Subscription length: weekly, monthly, yearly\n• Your payment will be charged to your iTunes Account as soon as you confirm your purchase.\n• You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal from your Account Settings after the purchase.\n• Your subscription will renew automatically, unless you turn off auto-renew at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n• The cost of renewal will be charged to your account in the 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n• When canceling a subscription, your subscription will stay active until the end of the period.

"description":"Worried about unprotected Wi-Fi hotspots? Touch VPN – the unlimited VPN – is the solution for you!\n\n***** Highlights of Touch VPN *****\n\n-- Free (with Ads):  To remove ads, you can choose monthly or yearly subscription.\n\n-- Unlimited: Truly unlimited.

Just shoot an email to support!\n\n-------------\n\nWhat is a VPN: VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. When connecting to a VPN server through Touch VPN for example - it sets up a secured and encrypted connection to an external server. Because of the encryption process, the data cannot be filtered.\n\nWhy using a VPN: With a VPN, your online privacy and security will be greatly bolstered as you’ll be surfing the web protected.\n\nVPN vs. Proxy: VPN and Proxy can both conceal user identity through re-routing your internet traffic. A Proxy server is, however, completely browser-based, and might not be compatible with certain web pages that use non-browser technology. Unlike a Proxy, a VPN service encrypts all your traffic and will work with all internet based services. In summary, VPN will provide you with more online privacy and security.\n\nWith Touch VPN you can：\n\n* When you’re connected to a public Wi-Fi Hotspot, your name, passwords, and personal information can be easily compromised. Touch VPN encrypts your data and provides you with banking-level security for the best protection. \n\n* Touch VPN is a one-click VPN Proxy Service. Touch VPN contains only one button. The button connects you to one of many servers at speeds faster than a web proxy. When you are not running our app we help you save your device's battery.\n\n* Surf the Web Privately.  Your real IP address is concealed and your internet activity is inaccessible to prying eyes and businesses.\n\n--------------\n\nSubscription:\n\nYou can be an Elite user through auto-renewable subscription. Choose between monthly and yearly plans and enjoy VPN with no Ads from virtual location of your choice.\n\n– Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n– Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n– Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n– Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n– Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nLegal:\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.northghost.com/privacy\nTerms of Service: https://www.northghost.com/terms", "bundleId":"com.northghost.touchvpnios", "trackName":"Touch VPN — Unlimited Proxy", "minimumOsVersion":"9.0", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2018-09-29T00:34:52Z"},

(Free VPN version may show some ads. Upgrade to Hi VPN Premium to enjoy ad-free VPN, if you prefer.)\n\nWhat is a VPN and Why Would I Need One?\n\nA VPN, or Virtual Private Network, allows you to create a secure connection to another network over the Internet. VPNs can be used to shield your browsing activity from prying eyes on public Wi-Fi, and more.\n\nIn very simple terms, a VPN connects your PC, smartphone, or tablet to another computer (called a server) somewhere on the internet, and allows you to browse the internet using that computer’s internet connection. So if that server is in a different country, it will appear as if you are coming from that country, and you can potentially access things that you couldn’t normally.\n\nThe vast majority of people these days are using VPN. They are still very useful for protecting yourself while working at a coffee shop, but that’s hardly the primary use anymore.\n\nHi VPN Premium service includes:\n\n• 3-day free trial: free of charge; no commitment; cancel anytime.\n• Price of subscription: one-year plan: $3.99/mo; 6-month plan: $5.33/mo; monthly plan: $7.99/mo.\n• Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n• Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n• Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal.\n• Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.\n• Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nTerms of Use: http://bit.ly/HiVPNTerms\nPrivacy Policy: http://bit.ly/HiVPNPrivacy\n\nCopyright © 2019 Hi Security Lab.

"description":"• #1 ad blocking solution for iOS\n• Over 750 000 app downloads worldwide\n• No in-app purchases, no subscription. Simple one-time payment\n• Top Utility ranked in all App Stores around the world \n• Over 1000+ carefully crafted filters\n• Easy setup in under 1 minute with detailed tutorial\n• Now with built-in Safari Content Blocker for better web ad protection\n\nWeblock allows you to control how your device fetches online content. Easily manage PAC (Proxy Auto-Config) script and route different connections through different proxy servers. Weblock can make your device download ads (banners and popups), stats and user tracking, scripts or images through a proxy server you pick. It also allows you to use a different proxy for specific websites, like Facebook, Twitter, Google+, social widgets from websites. You can even define your own content filters. With Weblock you can control proxy for basically any network resource! This way you can choose not to reveal your real IP to different services, limit advanced ad targeting and protect your privacy.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICE: You're responsible for selecting a proxy server that allows you to download content you wish to download. We DO NOT provide a proxy service. Using a bad proxy server (like 127.0.0.1:8021) might result in some resources being blocked. You can control your proxy settings selectively with Weblock. Contact our support if you need help choosing right proxy server or setting up Weblock on your device.\n\nHere are some situations in which Weblock might come in handy:\n• Fetch ads through a proxy server you choose. Protect your privacy and prevent ad servers from knowing your real IP address and tracking you.\n• Disable majority of ads on websites you visit on your iOS device! Weblock supports all major web browsers: Safari, Chrome, Mercury and others (browsers redirecting web traffic through third-party servers like Puffin Browser or Opera Mini are not be supported).\n• Easily remove all native Facebook widgets and plugins (Like buttons, comments, etc.) on sites you visit - simply disable Facebook plugins in Weblock! Do the same for Twitter, Google+ and other social media.\n• Stop annoying Tapatalk popups, nagging you to download forum browsing app on every visit.\n• Take control of someone else's device - you can preconfigure any iOS device to control it with your Weblock app. Block or redirect any content, anytime, directly from your own device.\n• Your predefined filters and custom rules can be synced between all your iOS devices using iCloud.\n• If you wish to block something else, you can create your own rules and filters. You can block any URL (with regular expressions), domain or IP address. Don't know how? Let us know - we're here for you.\n• You can also use Weblock's redirect feature to emulate '/etc/hosts' entries for HTTP and HTTPS traffic. This might be useful for web and app developers to pin domains to different IP addresses.\n\n••• IMPORTANT! •••\nNeed help setting up Weblock?

"description":"+ \"Photon browser is a powerful and versatile Safari alternative that excels in its Flash support...\"  - USAToday \n+ Photon for iPad is #1 in Utilities in US, UK and top 30 overall app around the world.\n+ Photon plays flash videos, games and flash websites.\n\nAppsverse Photon Browser is a powerful new browser specifically designed to enhance your browsing experience on the iPhone and iPod Touch. It is packed with innovative features. Here are just some of them:\n\n1. Flash browsing support\n- Photon Browser allows you to play Flash games such as free Facebook games, use Flash apps and watch Flash video inline using its remote cloud browse mode.\n- Browse Flash websites that would otherwise not display on the iPhone.\n- Play music that streams through a Flash player.\n- Read news that require Flash support.\n- Press the “Lightning” icon on the bottom right navigation bar when you encounter a Flash website on the iPhone or iPod Touch.\n- Combines fast native browsing for normal websites and remote browsing for Flash websites. Switch between the 2 modes using the lightning bolt button (for Flash) or the web globe button (for native browsing).\n- Support different mode such as pointer mode for precision that makes your iPhone acts like a mouse pad. Supports touch mode for scrolling and touch/click. Supports drag mode for dragging around game maps.\n- Zoom in flash. PLEASE WAIT a second or two for the zoom to update before zooming again on iPhone and iPod touches.\n- We support audio. PLEASE MAKE sure your mute switch is not on.\n\n2. Fully featured powerful browser\n- Private browsing clears history, cookies and caches upon browser exit.\n- Anonymous browsing through our servers.\n- Share content via email.\n- Brightness control for night time browsing.\n- Rotation lock for playing web based games.\n- Personalize your browser by choosing from thousands of colors.\n\n3. Others\n- Bookmarks support\n- Print web pages using AirPrint.\n- More innovative features to come\n\nImportant notes - PLEASE READ BEFORE BUYING:\n- When you encounter a Flash website, REMEMBER TO CLICK ON the \"Lightning Bolt\" button to enter Flash streaming mode. Otherwise, you will see the standard Adobe message that Flash needs to be installed or upgraded as you are still in the native browser mode. Only by explicitly clicking on the \"Lightning\" button will you then be able to view Flash content.\n\n- If you have a slow Internet connection such as over a slow 3G network, remote browsing feature may have slow performance even though we have made great technological improvements to support Flash over low bandwidth. Flash mode works best over Wifi in a broadband network. Just because you have Wifi does not mean you have a fast network. Wifi is fast enough but your bottleneck is the wired connection that your Wifi sits on. However, you can still use Photon as a fast native browser for your regular browsing.\n\n- If you have problems, do not hesitate to contact us given in the support link on iTunes. We are extremely responsive and answer questions within 1-3 business days.

"description":"ProtonVPN’s mission is to make advanced online privacy and security available to everyone. With ProtonVPN, you can:\n- Protect your privacy by hiding your IP address\n- Browse the web securely (even on public WiFi)\n- Visit blocked/censored websites\n\nProtonVPN is a community-supported VPN developed by the same team of scientists that created ProtonMail, the world’s largest encrypted email service. ProtonVPN has a free plan so anybody can use it. You can upgrade to a paid plan to unlock all features.\n\n\nWhy ProtonVPN?\n\n- NO LOGS. EVER\nProtonVPN is a no logs VPN service. We do not track or record your Internet activity, and therefore, cannot disclose this information to third parties.\n\n- STRONG ENCRYPTION\nOur VPN app for iOS uses the IKEv2 protocol. We use only the highest-strength encryption to protect your Internet connection. This means all your network traffic is encrypted with AES-256 and uses 2048-bit RSA key exchange.\n\n- PERFECT FORWARD SECRECY\nProtonVPN uses ciphers with Perfect Forward Secrecy, meaning your encrypted traffic cannot be captured and decrypted later, even if an encryption key gets compromised in the future.\n\n- SWISS BASED\nProtonVPN is a Swiss company, which means you are protected by some of the strongest privacy regulations in the world. \n\n- TRUSTED\nUnlike other VPN services, we provide full transparency so you know who is running the service. Whether it is challenging governments, educating the public, or training journalists, we are well known for fighting for privacy online and contributing to the open source community.\n\n- FREE\nProtonVPN is the ONLY free VPN service that has no privacy invading ads, no malware, no bandwidth limits, and does not secretly sell user data. The free service is supported by optional paid plans that come with more servers and more features.\n\n\nPaid ProtonVPN plans come with additional features, such as:\n\n- HIGH SPEED GLOBAL NETWORK\nProtonVPN has hundreds of servers located all around the world, accessible via a single click. All servers are on high speed 1 Gbit or 10 Gbit connections. Free users can only access slower servers in 3 countries.\n\n- SECURE CORE VPN\nRegular VPN services can be compromised if their servers are under surveillance. ProtonVPN prevents this by first passing user traffic through our Secure Core network in privacy-friendly countries like Switzerland and Iceland.

"description":"Private Internet Access VPN\n\nProtect your privacy with Private Internet Access®, the world's leading VPN service for iOS users on iPhone and iPad. Private Internet Access®, or PIA, enables users to encrypt their network traffic and stay protected when online with our proxy servers. Add privacy and security to private and public networks when you browse the Internet and use WiFi, whether connected to a hotspot or at home. High speeds, unlimited bandwidth, connect with 5 devices simultaneously (smartphones, tablets, computers), no traffic logs, and 24/7 professional, native English speaking customer support.\n\nWHY USE VPN FROM PRIVATE INTERNET ACCESS®?\n\n• Low price. $3.33 per month if you purchase a yearly account ($39.99/year) or $6.99 on a monthly basis.\n• Reliable and trusted VPN provider since 2010 with a proven no log policy.\n• Privacy is our Policy. Here at PIA, we not only provide a great VPN service at a low price, but we also support organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, FightForTheFuture, Creative Commons, Open Rights Group, Index on Censorship, freenode, Wireguard, Arch Linux, and many others.\n\nWe respect your privacy and anonymity.\n\nBY USING VPN FROM PRIVATE INTERNET ACCESS®, YOU GET:\n\n• IP Cloaking. Your IP address will be changed to a Private Internet Access IP address to hide your identity and location. Hide your IP address to stop data trackers, snoopers, and hackers from tracking your browsing and search activity.\n\n• Data Encryption. Encrypt your internet traffic with our VPN proxy. Our trusted online privacy service creates several security layers which keep you anonymous and prevent access to your data. It’s time to change your WiFi habits. Don’t use WiFi without our secure VPN to proxy your internet traffic!\nWiFi Security. With WPA and WPA2 now kracked, you need a VPN to protect your WiFi everywhere - not just in hotspots, coffee shops, cafes, hotels, and airports. If you use WiFi hotspots without encryption, your data can be seen, blocked, throttled, censored, or otherwise changed.\n\n• Content Blocker. The Safari Content Blocker blocks ads, trackers, and malware while browsing with Safari.\n\nWHAT DO OUR CUSTOMERS THINK?\n\n“Firstly, the company is second to none in terms of support, troubleshooting, and individualized assistance. Their nodes and hubs are top speed. Their client is streamlined and has a tremendous ease of use.”\nJAYDLUV, 10/10/2017\n\n“This is my go to app for VPN. Been using Windows version for years and the iPad version is great.”\nPkcarreon, 09/18/2017\n\n“No hiccups, no crashes or anything. It just works great. Bear in mind you have to subscribe to the service for this to work. I highly recommend it.”\nScott Loflin, 09/15/2017\n\n“Simple and solid. No issues even when traveling.”\nJoe1134206, 09/8/2017\n\n“Love it. Feel safer when browsing the internet.”\nCachuco, 08/7/2017\n\n“Hard to find a nit with this app. (...) The iOS app allows a quicker toggle on/off than digging into settings, for VPN hostile iOS apps like Pandora and Netflix. I like PIA’s value for the money, and I have not had any trouble whatsoever with the iOS app. I recommend this app, and PIA, as one of your layers of online security.”\nDB Associates, 01/27/2017\n\n“I did my homework, reviewing many VPN services. PIA was among the most economical, plenty of simultaneous connections and more than enough servers and services. (...) The speed is more than I hoped for. I can stream all YouTube videos. HD quality is superb with no buffering. I am happy to have this extra security on all our devices. My wife could not tell the difference after I installed it on her PC. I think I paid $39.99/year. What a bargain!”\nHelmut, 06/20/2016\n\nGDPR compatibility\n\nThis application only sends username and encrypted passwords to our servers as part of using this app. During signups, we also collect user's email.

"description":"Everything on your iPhone or iPad uses the internet. Your email apps, web browsers, photo apps, banking apps, chat and social apps. \n\nHaving secure internet access is critical and wifi routers are hacked every day. VPN Freely will encrypt your internet traffic preventing WiFi hackers from collecting data mid-stream. It can also help you access sites that may otherwise be blocked.\n\nVPN Freely is the easiest way to secure your iPhone/iPad wifi & cellular internet activity. By simply clicking the \"Secure Me\" button you will be connected to our ultra secure Virtual Private Network. While connected you can safely surf the web, shop online and use banking apps without worry.\n\nStay Connected. Stay Safe.\n\nWhat's so great about VPN Freely?\n\n- Free iOS VPN for iPhone and iPad\n- Stealth Mode **NEW**\n- WiFi Hotspot Security\n- One Click Instant Access to Connect (No Sign-Up Required)\n- No Email, Names or Phone Numbers Required\n- 256 bit Bank Grade VPN Server Encryption\n- No Server Logs or Activity Tracking\n- We never sell user data. None of it. Ever.\n- Your internet traffic will travel over our secure IP similar to a Proxy\n- Encrypt the internet connection to your web browsers and mobile apps\n- No daily limits on usage\n- No data limits on streaming and downloads\n- Built on servers trusted by millions\n- Double the speed of your Free account by subscribing to our Newsletter\n\nAbout our Premium iOS VPN Service Subscriptions:\n\n- Go Premium to remove your speed limits and stop ads\n- Go Premium to remove the 30min session timeout \n- Go Premium to use Stealth Mode\n- Premium subscriptions are tied to your Apple ID.

However, just because your phone wants to connect to a WiFi hotspot doesn't mean it's safe. The fact is your phone can't tell you if the hotspot is safe or not. \n\nIf the hotspot is not secure other people online may be able to see your internet activity. Hackers love to sniff data on coffee shop WiFi networks because the customers feel comfortable there just like it's home. If the customer is comfortable they'll do things like personal banking online. This is why no public WiFi connection should be trusted.\n\nThe Solution = VPN Freely\n\nIt's so easy! One simple rule...\n\nAfter connecting to a Public WiFi Hotspot. Always, open your iPhone VPN Freely app (or iPad) and click \"Secure Me\". \n\nJust like that your internet access is encrypted and secured. It really is easy to surf the web safely. \n\nDownload VPN Freely today! \n\nDon't forget to try our Premium iOS VPN upgrade for free!\n\nWebsite: http://vpnfreely.com\nPrivacy Policy:  http://vpnfreely.com/privacy\nTerms of Service:  http://vpnfreely.com/terms\n\nNeed help?

"description":"Speedify makes your internet secure and fast with the magic of Channel Bonding! “Hands down, the fastest VPN service,” according to Tom’s Guide. Even The Wall Street Journal hails Speedify as the best solution for sticky Wi-Fi.\n\nOur unique channel bonding technology enables you to securely use multiple Internet connections at the same time. This means you get increased bandwidth, lower latency, and better reliability. How? Once you’re connected to our global network of VPN servers, Speedify intelligently distributes online traffic between all available internet connections, so that you’ll never have to worry about buffering videos, slow streaming, or interrupted downloads again.  \n\nRELIABLE INTERNET — WHEREVER YOU GO! \n\nHate when your audio stops or video pauses because you stepped a few feet outside of your Wi-Fi range? With our seamless failover feature, Speedify moves your activity over to the other connection without missing a beat or skipping a frame, making it the perfect mobile VPN. Our extensive server list means you can access the websites you need no matter where you are in the world--always with a fast, secure, and reliable connection.\n\nTEST YOUR CONNECTION SPEEDS\n\nTry out our integrated internet speed test. Measure latency and upload and download speeds over your existing Wi-Fi and cellular connections. Then compare these to speeds over our bonded VPN to see the difference!\n\nSECURITY AND PRIVACY\n\nUsing the latest encryption standards, Speedify delivers a super secure connection to ensure that no ones sees your sensitive information.

"description":"IntelliVPN is a VPN service that uses the IPSec / IKEv2 protocol and bank-level encryption. VPN service provides encryption of traffic, which ensures the security of the data you transmit through public networks, such as public Wi-Fi.\n\nIntelliVPN gives you access to VPN servers in over 20+ regions around the world.\n\nYour provider cannot track or restrict your online activity.  All resources you visit (websites, social media, etc.) will see IP addresses of our VPN servers instead of your IP.\n\nWhy IntelliVPN?\n\na. Bank-level encryption (AES-256)\n\nIntelliVPN uses a 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm that ensures your personal data protection. It is impossible to tap your data; hackers or fraudsters have no chance to access it.

Absolute anonymity in the Internet\n\nIntelliVPN hides your actions and location from service providers, website administrators, search engines, and fraudsters. All of them see the IP-address of our server instead of your personal one. That makes it impossible to detect your actual location and name of your Internet provider based on IP.\n\nc. No restrictions\n\nIntelliVPN has no restrictions on the speed or volume of transmitted data. Communicate in social networks, listen to music and watch films and series without being concerned about Internet traffic.\n\nd. Access to Tor network\n\nIntelliVPN provides access to Tor network and transparent access to .onion sites without the need for the use of specialised browsers.\n\n=== Premium ===\n\nTo gain access to an extended list of ultra fast servers and priority technical support, you can subscribe to the Premium version.\nPremium available via auto-renewable subscription. We offer following subscription options:\n\n- One month for $4.99\n- One year for $44.99\n\nAll subscription options include 3-days trial period\n\n=== Subscription details ===\n\nA subscription will renew at the end of each month unless cancelled.\n\n- Payments will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n- An account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours priority to end of current period.\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.\n- No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during an active subscription period.\n\n=== Feedback ===\n\nIf you have comments or questions about IntelliVPN, please send them to us at support@intellivpn.net.\n\nWe are also on Twitter: @IntelliVPN\n\nOur privacy policy: https://intellivpn.net/privacy_privacy.html\nTerms of service: https://intellivpn.net/terms_of_service.html", "bundleId":"net.intellivpn.ios", "trackName":"IntelliVPN - strong VPN", "minimumOsVersion":"9.3", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2019-02-15T12:30:05Z"},

"description":"SSH Tunnel is the best and most convenient way to manage SSH tunnels on a mobile device running iOS.\n\nThe application allows you to configure a local socks5 proxy with a private tunnel to your own server.\n\nMain functions and features of the application:\n\n- The application works in the background. It will run in the background and will not fall asleep while at least one tunnel is connected\n- Supports local and dynamic port forwarding (aka socks5 proxy)\n- Password or Private Key authentication\n- Host Key Fingerprint checking\n- Connection data transfer statistics\n- Connection Export & Import\n- Passcode & Face ID protection\n- Provides a local URL for a Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) file\n- Disconnect notification\n- Idle disconnect timer\n- Advanced logging for a debug purpose\n\nYou need to have an SSH server configured to use this application.\n\nThe advantage of the SSH Tunnel is the ability to fully control traffic redirection. The application allows manual configuration of the PAC (Proxy Auto-Config) file using special rules. For example, redirection depending on the Wi-Fi network to which the phone is connected (home/work), time of day or the address of the requested resource itself.\n\nSSH Tunnel support email: support@mobibean.zendesk.com", "bundleId":"bushev.ssh.tunnel", "trackName":"SSH Tunnel - with socks5 proxy", "minimumOsVersion":"11.0", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2019-02-21T23:27:54Z"},

"description":"Proxy connects you to your friends nearby. Whether you’re traveling on the other side of the world, hanging on the other side of town, or chilling at home, Proxy shows you who of your friends are nearby right now. Share what you are doing and see what friends are up to with status messages. Start a conversation on Proxy and meet up in person.\n\nProxy shares your proximity with friends nearby, not your exact location, so friends will only see that you’re “<1 mi” or “5 mi” away, not that you’re at Magic: The Gathering store (unless you say so in your status). \n\nProxy currently uses Facebook to connect you to your nearby friends. It will provide alternative onboarding methods such as phone contacts in the future, but Proxy currently requires Facebook.\n\n*** We have shutdown the Proxy server to focus on other projects (see Whammy in the App Store). Thanks to those of you that used Play. If you really want Play to come back, send us a message at info@joinproxy.com ***\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Proximity: Proxy doesn’t share your exact location with anyone, only your proximity (e.g. 5 miles) with friends who are nearby.\n\n* Status: Share what you are doing with friends nearby and see what they’re up to with status messages.\n\n* Messaging: Quickly connect with friends nearby via text messages.\n\n* Context: Status messages and conversations are in the moment and will clear as your context (location and time) changes.\n\n* Ghost Mode and blocking: Easily block individual users or switch into Ghost Mode to temporarily stop sharing your proximity with all users.\n\n* Privacy: Proxy doesn’t store your past locations, statuses, or conversations. \n\n* Low energy footprint: Proxy doesn't constantly update your location in the background so it will not negatively affect your battery charge.\n\n\nWhy use Proxy:\n\n* “In the present”: While most social apps remove you from your present situations, Proxy is entirely focused on here and now. “Spend less time looking at your friends’ photos and more time in them.”\n\n* “In the know”: While most social apps keep you in the know about news or cute animal videos that your friends like, Proxy keeps you in the know about what your friends are up to right now in your proximity.\n\n* “In the proxy”: Proxy turns your immediate proximity into a constant party.

"description":"The iOS comes with built-in HTTP proxy, anyone who needs them can easily find these setting in system preference. However, there still comes a tiny flaw: HTTP proxy can't be used under 4G.\nAnother concern of this app is the PAC (proxy auto-config) files. In most situation, one PAC file will be enough, but when you need multiple PAC files from multiple different resources, the user may have to learn how to merge them, make the situation even worse.\nSo here comes the solution: Filter proxy! It allows you to use HTTP proxy under 4G, make it a quite handy tool for iOS developers, especially when developers are trying to debug behavior specific to 4G. It also allows you to use multiple PAC files as rules, only the rule matched first get the chance to decide which proxy to go.\nBest of all, this app will capture absolute zero data from you - and you can verify that by download source code from https://github.com/cnnblike/discord.

"description":"GATT-IP is the reference application using the Open Source Bluetooth Proxy Protocol. GATT-IP protocol helps transfer data from Bluetooth Smart devices to the cloud or remote systems. Bluetooth LE devices are designed to work with local connection. With the new release of the GATT-IP protocol, this enables connecting Bluetooth LE devices to remote devices via the IP network. \nThe core essence of Bluetooth LE is Generic Attribute Profile (GATT), which is built on top of the Attribute Protocol (ATT) and establishes common operations and a framework for the data transported and stored by the Attribute Protocol. GATT defines two roles: Server and Client. With the release of GATT-IP, the two roles are now extended from local near range access to remote access from anywhere. The protocol is simple with the ability to control any Bluetooth LE /Smart device remotely from any Internet connected browser. GATT-IP is based on JSON-RPC to allow accessing remote Bluetooth devices via a series of procedure calls to control the devices just like you would when connected locally. \nGATT-IP bridges the gap between smaller embedded devices to network connected systems, including data collection systems to collect and monitor. This helps Internet Of Things platforms to stay connected to Bluetooth LE devices with simple extensions.\n\nFor more information on GATT-IP go to www.gatt-ip.org", "bundleId":"org.gatt-ip.app", "trackName":"GATT-IP - Bluetooth SMART/LE Proxy Protocol", "minimumOsVersion":"8.0", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2016-10-14T11:16:02Z"},

"description":"Onion Browser is a Tor-powered web browser that helps you access the internet with more privacy.\n\nThe best Tor-related offering on iOS right now is Onion Browser.\n\n--------------------\n\n• Internet access tunneled over the Tor network:\n- Websites do not see your real IP address.\n- ISPs and insecure wireless networks cannot see your browsing.\n- Access .onion websites: anonymous \"hidden service\" sites only accessible through Tor.\n- Can access websites, even behind some types of internet filters and censors. (See DISCLAIMERS below.)\n\n• Fight online tracking: use a new IP address and clear your cookies/history/cache in one button.\n\n• Block third party cookies or all cookies.\n\n• Disable scripts and multimedia content that can be used to track you.\n\nDISCLAIMERS:\nWeb browsing is much slower than through a normal web browser due to relaying through the Tor anonymization network.\n\nMultimedia can bypass Tor and compromise your privacy; video files and video streams are not supported and are blocked by default.\n\nOnion Browser does not function in China, Iran, and other locations that actively block Tor with \"deep packet inspection\" technology. Internet providers who use such filtering/censorship technology may also prevent Onion Browser from working. If you find that the app does not work, visit the Help/Support page to see what you can do.\n\nOnion Browser relies on other projects including The Tor Project and OpenSSL. Use of Onion Browser is at your own risk; sensitive data does not always belong on a mobile device.

"description":"Now it’s even easier to get hold of Japanese items via Otsukai with our smartphone app! \nJust download, log in with your existing account and make a request for the Japanese merchandise you want to add to your collection! Don’t have an Otsukai account? You can sign up to Otsukai from within the app in seconds.\n\n~Otsukai is a Japanese proxy buying service with a difference!~\nWe connect you with real Japanese users who will help you hunt down those items you’ve been struggling to find! \nJust upload a description of the item you are looking for, and the Japanese users will make their move!\nIf one of their offers catches your eye, you can pay for the item right away and send the user on an errand to get the item for you.\n\nSigning up and requesting is simple!\n\nWe especially recommend this service if you:\n- Are a lover of Japanese anime, manga or pop culture\n- Struggle to get hold of Japan-exclusive items, especially rare items\n- Want to pre-order items from Japan\n- Hope to get hold of items only available at events in Japan\n- Are on the hunt for a particular item, but not sure where to start looking\n\n—— FAQ\n\n“How do I use Otsukai?”\n\n1) Make a request for the Japanese item you are looking for\n2) Wait for JP users to search for the item and make you an offer\n3) Accept and pay for the offer you like best. Otsukai will safely hold onto your money.\n4) Wait for the Friend to get hold of the item and ship it to you\n5) Let us know when you receive the item, and we pass the money on to the JP user\n\n“What makes Otsukai different to other proxy-buying services?”\n\nOtsukai is more than just a proxy-buying service. We act as an in-between for you and regular Japanese otaku who can search for the item on your behalf. Some of the things that make us different are:\n~ You can ask JP users to hunt for a rare item you haven’t found listed online yet\n~ You don’t need to be specific (For example, you can request ‘Badges and keyrings of X from Y’)\n~ Request items from Japanese events\n~ If the item you want is unavailable, you may get offers with similar items that you didn’t even think of! This is quite popular with our users!\n\n“Does Otsukai charge me? Will I be hit with hidden charges?”\n\nSigning up and making requests is absolutely free. You will never be charged if you don’t purchase an item, no matter how many requests you make.\nOtsukai runs on a 10% service charge, which is already included in the offer price. All charges, such as shipping, PayPal charges and our service charge are all calculated at the time that the Friend makes the offer. That means that THE PRICE YOU ARE OFFERED IS THE PRICE YOU WILL PAY. You will never be hit with extra charges from Otsukai.\n[Please note that any customs charges are entirely the buyer’s responsibility]\n\n“Is Otsukai safe? Is it not a target place for scammers?”\n\nOtsukai exists for the safety of both you and the JP users. Once you pay for your item, Otsukai will keep the money safe until you have safely received your goodies. We only pass the JP user’s remittance onto them once you have let us know that your item has safely arrived. We will step in right away if we feel there is scamming involved, and we regularly monitor both the requests and offers being made on Otsukai.\n\n“I’m a little confused about something”\n\nFeel free to message our support center if you are unsure of anything. \nYou can find the link both on our homepage and from within the app.\nOur Japanese and English-speaking staff will get back to you as soon as they can.\n[Our office hours are 09:00-18:00 Mon-Fri, excluding Japanese national holidays]", "bundleId":"jp.gradus.otsukai", "trackName":"Otsukai", "minimumOsVersion":"11.0", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2019-03-21T01:47:25Z"},
