Onion Browser helps you access the internet with more safety and privacy, and no extra cost to you.\n\n“The best Tor-related offering on iOS right now is Onion Browser” - The Daily Dot, October 14, 2015.\n\nFeatured in: The New York Times, The Guardian, Salon, TechCrunch, Gizmodo, Boing Boing, Lifehacker, Macworld, The Daily Dot, & others.\n\nFEATURES:\n• Browse the internet over Tor:\n- Protect your privacy from website tracking\n- Secure your traffic from insecure wireless networks and ISPs\n- Support for HTTPS Everywhere, an automatic switch to HTTPS enabled websites\n- Access .onion sites that are only accessible over Tor.\n\n• Fight online tracking: block scripts and automatically clear cookies and tabs, based on your preferences.\n\n• And more privacy-enhancing features!\n\nDISCLAIMERS:\n- Web browsing is much slower than through a normal web browser or a VPN because your traffic is encrypted and relayed through the Tor network.\n\n- Multimedia often bypass Tor and compromise your privacy; video files and video streams are blocked by default and are not supported by Onion Browser.\n\n- Onion Browser might not work on networks with advanced network restrictions. If the app does not connect, try using bridges (or a different type of bridge), force-quit, and then restart the app.\n\n- Use of Onion Browser is at your own risk; remember that sensitive data does not always belong on a mobile device.\n\n** Onion Browser is free and open-source software.

"description":"Purple Onion is a free browser that empowers you to use the internet more securely.  Purple Onion uses Tor to encrypt your Internet traffic and then hides it by bouncing through a series of computers around the world. Tor is free software and an open network that helps you defend against a form of network surveillance that threatens personal freedom and privacy, confidential business activities and relationships, and state security known as traffic analysis.  Purple Onion is the only app that creates a truly private internet connection. \n\nACCEPT NO SUBSTITUTES: Purple Onion is the safest way to use the Internet - Period.  Purple Onion bounces your encrypted traffic several times through computers around the world, instead of connecting you directly like VPNs and proxies. This process takes a little longer, but the strongest privacy and identity protection available is worth the wait.\n\nPRIVATE WEB SURFING:  Purple Onion is the most anonymous way to access any website, even if it’s normally blocked, monitored, or on the hidden web. \n\nPRIVACY FOR EVERYONE: Tor can help you confidentially research a competitor, get around someone blocking your favorite site, or circumvent a firewall to watch sports at work.\n\n***We Love Feedback***\nMESSAGE US: Are we missing your favorite feature? Found an annoying bug? We’d love to hear from you! Send us an email. \n jcltravels@gmail.com\n\nImportant Notes:\n- Web browsing/downloading through the anonymization network will be SIGNIFICANTLY SLOWER than through a non-tunneled browser like Safari. This is necessary and a small price to pay to keep your identity protected.\n- This product uses the Tor distributed networks is produced independently from the Tor(r) anonymity software and carries no guarantee from The Tor Project about quality, suitability or anything else.", "trackId":1445447109, "bundleId":"com.jcltravels.Firefox", "trackName":"Purple Onion - TOR Browser VPN", "genreIds":["6002", "6007"],
