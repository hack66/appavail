"description":"OpenSignal is the ultimate signal toolkit that shows you how to get a better network connection instantly, find nearby free Wifi hotspots worldwide, view signal maps so that you can compare performance of networks in your area and test the speed of your mobile or Wifi connection. \n\nUnlike other apps, which look for maximum possible speed through optimized testing, OpenSignal informs you about your true speed - what you are likely to experience when normally using your phone. Anyone using the app contributes data, informing others about real-world, not estimated, mobile performance (and we'll never ask you for personal information, just your signal strength stats).\n\nWith OpenSignal you can map cellular coverage, find Wi-Fi hotspots, test and improve your reception & get faster data.\n\n- Signal compass points you in the direction your signal is coming from \n- Speed test for download, upload and latency\n- Map of cell towers and Wifi hotspots\n- Coverage maps allow you see the best/worst places for 2G, 3G and 4G \n- Free and ad-free\n\nBased on our community-generated data we are able to help keep you better connected by giving you a practical solution to the problems of slow mobile internet. Simply follow our signal compass to walk towards better phone signal or see our in-app copoverage maps to work out which carrier is best for where you are, useful if you're thinking about switching networks. Our wifi maps help you find local public-access wireless networks (Wifi hotspots).\n\nMaps are not updated in real-time. Don’t worry though, we log the information you share with us to improve our coverage maps and performance information.

Then, simply put your iPhone, iPad, or iPod to sleep by pressing the button no the top.\n\nIt's that easy.\n\nYou can rest assured (literally) that you'll be on time for that final exam or business flight because Crazy Alarm Clock will send you 5 timed alerts, a minute apart. Just to warn you, there is no \"Snooze\" button! We can't guarantee that you'll get restful sleep, but you WILL get out of bed.\n\nEven if you just need a simple daily signal or a safe, timed plan to keep dinner from getting charred, Crazy Alarm Clock is the key. Here's what you get:\n\n- Simplicity – Listen to the loud sounds, choose one, and set the alarm.\n- Easy Sorting – Select your favorite sounds or arrange alphabetically.\n- Cool Design – Check out the screenshots below.\n- Obnoxious Sounds – The air horn WILL wake you up!\n- Great Extras – Upgrade to get full access to all the crazy sounds.\n\nNobody wants to be the idiot who sleeps through college graduation.

"description":"Confide is your confidential messenger. With end-to-end encrypted, self-destructing, and screenshot-proof messages, Confide gives you the comfort of knowing that your private communication will now truly stay that way.\n\n• Messages are end-to-end encrypted\n• Messages disappear forever once they are read\n• Screenshot-proof messages with our patent-pending ScreenShield technology\n• Send text, photos, videos, documents and voice messages\n• 1-to-1 and group messaging\n• Available for mobile, desktop, iMessage and Siri\n\nAlso available from Confide:\n\nConfide Plus — More features. More control.\n• Unlimited attachments\n• Retract (\"un-send\") an unread message\n• Nicknames\n• Themes\n• Priority customer support\n\nConfide has been used in over 180 countries and has been featured in Fortune, Forbes, Bloomberg, NYT, WSJ, Washington Post and more.\n\nConfide allows you to communicate digitally with the same level of privacy and security as the spoken word.\n\nGet Confide and retake control of your digital conversations.\n\n———\n\nScreenShield is a new technology that is only supported when the message recipient is using a recent version of Confide. But don’t worry, older versions of Confide are still screenshot-protected by our reading experience.\n\n———\n\nConfide for iMessage allows you to send and receive Confide messages entirely within iMessage. It’s completely frictionless – there’s no need to create an account. Due to technical limitations of iMessage, Confide for iMessage does not offer the same level of screenshot protection as the main version of Confide.\n\n———\n\nPrice may vary by location.

"description":"ChatSecure is a free and open source messaging app that features OTR encryption over XMPP. You can connect to an existing Google account, create new accounts on public XMPP servers (including via Tor), or even connect to your own server for extra security.\n\nUnlike other apps that keep you stuck in their walled garden, ChatSecure is fully interoperable with other clients that support OTR and XMPP, such as Adium, Jitsi, and more.\n\nChatSecure only uses well-known open source cryptographic libraries to keep your conversations private. Other apps may make claims about 'military grade' security but, without publicly auditable source code and verifiable end-to-end encryption, you cannot be truly safe.\n\n* XMPP with TLS certificate pinning.\n* OTR for verifiable end-to-end encryption and forward secrecy.\n* OMEMO for a mobile-friendly alternative to OTR.\n* Tor integration for easy access to XMPP .onion services.\n* SQLCipher to locally encrypt conversation logs.\n* Free and Open Source: https://github.com/chatsecure/chatsecure-ios\n\nFollow @ChatSecure on Twitter: https://twitter.com/chatsecure\n\n►► ChatSecure Donations\nSubscribe to ChatSecure to help make developing free and open source privacy tools sustainable.

By comparison, ReachFast is 1 to 3 times faster than other contacts apps in any given scenario.\n\n\nFeatures:\n* Pull-down to search, instead of tapping on a specific area. You can open the search without even looking at the screen.\n* Only One tap to call.\n* Two taps to Facetime.\n* Swipe right to message.\n* Favorites and Recently called contacts appear INLINE with the contacts... No need to switch tabs and the landing happens always on the recent, if you don't find the contact there, just pull down to search.\n* Smart search, that learns who you call the most and gives you the first result as a top hit, while reducing the number of letters you type before finding your contact.\n* Adding a contact is super fast. we don't stop you to ask if you are adding to existing or updating a new one, it happens along the way and reduces 3 steps out of the overall scenario.\n* While adding a contact, no need to move your finger and look at the upper screen to switch fields, you can swipe the keyboard to jump lines while keeping your fingers on the keyboard to save you time.\n* Forgot their names?

"description":"ABOUT THIS COURSE\n\nThis course introduces signal processing tools currently used in geophysics. It has been elaborated both from the book \"Signal processing for geologists and geophysicists\" (J.L. Mari, F. Glangeaud, F. Coppens, 1999) and from the CD \"Signal processing in geosciences\" (F. Glangeaud ,J.L. Mari, 2000).\n\nFor signal processing specialists, it will be a source of how classical or new theories can be applied to field data.Teaching staff should find it provides a means of tackling the teaching signal processing techniques.\n\n- - -\n\nFOREWORD\n\nThis on line course presents a succession of lessons classed by theme. The different themes that are tackled are:\n\n• The Fourier Transformation\n• Common functions in spectral analysis\n• Sampling\n• Correlation\n• Wave separation\n• Seismic applications\n• The Hilbert transformation\n• Filtering\n• Near Surface Geophysics\n• Stochastic Signal Processing\n• Attributes\n\nEach theme has an introduction and a series of lessons which are associated with it. A lesson comprises of text, a video, a formulary, if judged necessary, and in some cases an applet to practice.\n\n• The text present has been voluntarily reduced; its objective is put across by the animation. This objective may be the presentation of a specific transform used in signal processing and applied in seismic processing. The term \"transform\" is used here in a very general sense. It covers at times the notion of transformation, such as the Fourier transformation or filters such as the Wiener filter. The objective perhaps being to show the application of a \"transform\" on simulated synthetic data or on real acquired geophysical data.\n\n• The video is an illustration of the text. It permits a visualization of the data, to study the influence of processing parameters on the data. The images were conceived in a manner which permits an immediate visual comparison and that enables an evaluation of the influence of a parameter change on the data processing. If an applet is associated with the video, some parameters can be modified by moving the cursors, the calculations taking place in real time.\n\n• The formulary gives the mathematical formula used in the animation. The reader is invited to use the book cited above as a reference for the notations used and the demonstrations. The formulary should be considered as a simple memory aid.\n\nThe videos and the applets have been created thanks to the MUSTIG software ( mustig.free.fr, Gérard Lejeune).\nIn this on line course, 20 lessons can be selected. For the animations based on field data measurement, the authors or organisms that provide with them are mentioned.\n\nThis on line course does not constitute a complete course in itself ; referral to the basic signal processing texts remains essential.\n\n- - -\n\nTHE AUTHOR\n\nJean-Luc Mari is at present a geophysics professor at IFP School and an IFPEN expert. He supervises the MSc research program in \"Lithosphere, Basins, Petroleum\" part of the Master's program in Science and Technology (Paris VI).\n\nJean-Luc Mari is a member of the European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers.\n\nJean-Luc Mari is author and co-author of patents (in the field of acoustic well logging), numerous scientific articles and books on geophysical methods and signal processing.\n\nHe has been involved in the design and development of specific teaching aids (on-line (http://www-ig.unil.ch/cours/) and CD-ROMs).\n\nHis main fields of expertise are seismic acquisition and processing, geophysics of reservoirs and civil engineering.", "bundleId":"com.odysys.signalprocessing", "trackId":509996063, 
"releaseNotes":"A new subject entitled “Attributes” has been added. \nIn the “ Near surface geophysics”  subject, the lesson “ Flow” has been added.\nIn the “Stochastic Signal Processing” subject, the lesson  “Depth conversion” has been added.\nThe subjects “Seismic applications” and “ Dispersive waves” have been merged in a single subject” Seismic applications”\nThe “ Attribute”  subject is composed of 6 lessons. In the session, we give the fundamentals on the main seismic attributes. We show how signal processing tools are used to create the attributes. Through examples, we illustrate the applications of seismic attributes to seismic processing and interpretation:\n• Envelope\n• RMS-Amplitude\n• Instantaneous Phase\n• Instantaneous Frequency\n• Dip & Azimuth\n• Coherency\n\nNow, the different subjects that are tackled are: \n• The Fourier Transformation\n• Common functions in spectral analysis\n• Sampling\n• Correlation\n• Wave separation\n• Seismic applications\n• The Hilbert transformation\n• Filtering\n• Near Surface Geophysics\n• Stochastic Signal Processing\n• Attributes", "minimumOsVersion":"7.0"},

"description":"Our CoverageMap app empowers you to test network performance in areas where you live, work, and play. Not only does testing performance in your neighborhood provide you with useful insights, but the data you produce also helps carriers improve the quality of your mobile life.\n\nThe newest version of the app for iOS has expanded the functionality and ease of use found in previous versions to give you a personal network testing and comparison tool that’s better than ever. And whether you’re already familiar with our CoverageMap app or simply curious about testing mobile network performance in your neighborhood, you’ll quickly see how easy it is to get started.\n\nNew features:\n•\tImproved user interface. Our updated app not only boasts a beautiful new user interface, but it also makes it easy to find and select the options and settings you want to use before running a test. Plus, easily identify areas that have yet to be tested, and be the first to put yourself on the map. \n•\tA world of results on an expanded dashboard. Your test results can tell you a great deal about your daily mobile life. Get a broader understanding of your findings with new stats such as moving averages, histories, and more. \n•\tPersonalize your results. Wondering how performance with your carrier of choice compares between the office and at home? Now you can find out. Easily select multiple hexes on the map to compare your results, and find out if others are having the same experience. \n•\tTest how you want, when you want. Set your device to automatically run performance tests continuously, or sample network conditions in the background. Stop a test at any time with either setting. When you turn background collection on, you anonymously contribute information about your device’s data performance without using your data plan. \n•\tWe want to hear from you. While we love to see more and more data points appear on the map, you can also tell us about your experience in your own words. Whether it’s something you feel requires our attention, or you just want to say you’ve had a great experience testing performance, we want to hear from you.\n\nEnjoying the app?

"description":"Drakdoo is a Forex & Cryptocurrency trading app that offers touch friendly charts and intelligent alerts, allowing you to stay on top of all cryptocurrencies as well as traditional markets without being glued to the screen 24/7.\n\n- Perform in-depth analysis, annotate charts, using an interface tailored for mobile.\n\n- Continuous Notifications: Next to one-time alerts that fire when a price breach occurs, we also offer continuous alerts that fire each time the price moves by a configurable threshold.\n\n- Intelligent Alerts: Do you want to be notified when the current trend has a higher-than-normal probability of switching directions? Simply set up Parabolic SAR alert. Or, get notified via a Stochastic RSI alert when the market becomes overbought or oversold. MACD alerts fire each time a center line or signal line crossover occurs. Don't forget to setup an alert that fires when the Bollinger Bands are breached!\n\n- Next to the Forex pairs, all major cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), Ethereum (ETH), ...) and all major crypto exchanges (e.g. Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Huobi, Kraken, OKEX, Coinbase, Bitso, Poloniex, Bittrex, Bitcoin.co.id, and more...) are supported.\n\n- Not everybody is a programmer. Build your own indicator without programming, optionally spanning multiple charting periods.\n\n- You will be alerted in real-time when relevant price action occurs.\n\n- Setup just one alert and monitor all pairs, possibly hundreds, of an exchange.\n\nThe basic functionality of Drakdoo is free to use. There are three subscription plans that you can opt in to that enhance the basic functionality:\n\n- The Goldfish plan: next to price breach alerts, you will be able to make use of intelligent indicator alerts such as RSI. Price: $8.49 monthly, or, $68.99 annually.\n\n- The Shark plan: offering more advanced indicators, such as Ichimoku Cloud (a.o.) for advanced traders.  Price: $12.99 monthly, or, $103.99 annually.\n\n- The Whale plan: full featured functionality without compromise, including scripting your own indicator and exchange probing. Price: $16.99 monthly, or, $134.99 annually.\n\nPrices may vary depending on your country. Please refer to the plan browser available within the app for in depth plan comparisons.\n\nAll plans include a free trial of 3 days. Your iTunes account will be charged once you confirm your payment. Your subscription automatically renews. When this happens the same, the same iTunes account as the initial purchase will be charged again at the end of your subscription period unless auto-renew has been turned off in your iTunes Account Settings at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. In case of a price increase, your subscription will not automatically renew and you will be notified via your iTunes Account email address to opt-in for this increase.  In case of a price decrease, your subscription will still automatically renew, unless specified otherwise in your iTunes Account Settings. Turning off auto-renew or managing it, can be done at any time after purchase via your iTunes Account Settings.  Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.

"description":"Generate custom color noises including brown, pink, white, blue, and violet.  Customize noise further by using low and high cut filters. Simple modern interface remembers all settings for quick generation and utilizes advanced mathematical formulas to generate all audio waves.  There are no audio files included in the application binary which keeps app size to a minimum and app performance to a maximum.\n\nWhat are benefits of listening to white noise?\n- Helps you sleep by blocking distractions\n- Pacifies fussy and crying babies\n- Relaxes and reduces stress\n- Increases focus while enhancing privacy\n- Soothes headaches and migraines\n- Masks tinnitus (ringing of the ears)\n\nWhat are the different sound colors?\n- White noise sounds similar to static of an analog TV or radio station that has stopped broadcasting.   White noise has equal energy across all sound frequencies.\n- Brown noise sounds like a powerful waterfall.  It has more energy at the lower frequencies and if you have a good speaker system with a subwoofer you should be able to really feel it.\n- Pink noise's upper sound frequencies don't fall off as fast as they do with brown noise, so you'll get a little more punch. The most interesting thing about pink noise is it's found in almost all electronic devices (known as flicker noise) and even in biological systems.\n- Blue and violet noise are the opposites of pink and brown noise, respectively, and sound like spraying water from a garden hose. It has more energy at the higher frequencies which means more treble and less bass. \n- Curious to learn more about color noises?  Check out this article for all the details:  http://www.tmsoft.com/white-noise-player/\n\nDirections:\nDrag the Sound Color slider to select brown, pink, white, blue, violet, or somewhere in-between.  Next, drag the low and high cut filters to further customize to your liking.  Adjust device volume using the on-screen volume slider to a comfortable level.  You can also specify to play audio to any AirPlay supported device.  Toggle audio playback using the Play/Pause button.\n\nCreated by the audio experts at TMSOFT that brought you the famous White Noise app.  Check out all our apps and sounds at http://www.tmsoft.com/", "bundleId":"com.tmsoft.NoiseGenerator", "trackId":1206450560, "releaseNotes":"Updated libraries to be GDPR compliant and other minor improvements.", "minimumOsVersion":"8.0"},

"description":"Crude oil is a naturally-occurring substance found in certain rock formations in the earth and can be considered the most important commodity in the world today. The product and its derivatives can be found in many application of modern life from transportation to plastics.\n\nCurrently, there are two major benchmarks for world oil prices, West Texas Intermediate (WTI for short) and Brent crude oil. Both are light, sweet crude oils although WTI is relatively sweeter and lighter than its European counterpart. As a result of this, WTI often trades at a premium, usually by just a few dollars a barrel. However, due to a Libyan crisis, which has decreased the supply of light, sweet crude in the European region, and a supply glut at the main storage facility of WTI in Oklahoma, the premium/discount situation has changed and now Brent is more expensive than WTI.\n\nThe recent slump in oil prices present a good investment opportunity.\n\nKey features of Easy Oil Tracker:\n\n- Keep a close watch of the latest oil price using an easy to read dashboard so as to know when is a good time to enter or exit the market.\n- News ticker displaying important news related to oil.\n- Keep yourself informed of the latest news related to oil by reading the list of headline news.\n- Receive notification when oil price moves more than 7%.\n- Share current WTI/Brent oil price with family and friends.\n- Quick access to the Economic Calendar from Forex Factory.\n- Technical analysis of the prices. This can be used to identify potential entry/exit for your trades.\n\nEasy Indicators relies on your support to fund its development and server costs.

"description":"Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) which is developed by Gerald Appel in the late seventies, is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of prices. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-day exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-day EMA. A nine-day EMA of the MACD is called the \"signal line\".\n\nThe two most popular strategies to generate buy/sell signals from MACD are as follow:\n\nCenter Line Crossover\n==============\n1. Potential BUY signal is generated when the 12-day EMA moves above the 26-day EMA.\n2. Potential SELL signal is generated when the 12-day EMA moves below the 26-day EMA.\n\nSignal Line Crossover\n===============\n1. Potential BUY signal is generated when the MACD turns up and crosses above the signal line.\n2. Potential SELL signal is generated when the MACD turns down and crosses below the signal line.\n\nEasy MACD Crossover provides a comprehensive dashboard that allows you to view the BUY/SELL signals from two of the most popular and effective strategies on many popular instruments and across multiple timeframes (M5, M15, M30, H1, H4, D1) at one glance.
