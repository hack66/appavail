"description":"Skype keeps the world talking. Say “hello” with an instant message, voice or video call – all for free*, no matter what device they use Skype on. Skype is available on phones, tablets, PCs and Macs.\n\n• Video calls – Don’t just hear the cheers, see them! Get together with 1 or 24 of your friends and family on a HD video call. Watch everyone as they smile and cry when you tell them “We’re engaged!!!\" \n• Chat – Reach people instantly. Send messages to your friends, grab someone’s attention with @ mentions or create a group chat to plan a family reunion. \n• Share – Send photos and videos with your family and friends. Save shared photos and videos to your camera roll. Share your screen to make travel plans with friends or present designs to your team.\n• Voice calls – Camera shy? Make voice calls to anyone in the world on Skype. You can also call mobile and landlines at low rates.\n• Express yourself – Liven up conversations with emoticons, click on the “+” in chat to send a Giphy or images from the web and annotate images with words, lines and more.\n\n*Skype-to-Skype calls are free. Operator data charges may apply. We recommend using an unlimited data plan or WiFi connection.\n\nCall landline and device numbers and send SMS messages anywhere in the world at affordable prices using Skype. Reach non-Skype users or contacts who are not online by choosing Skype Credit or Skype subscriptions. \n \nChoose Skype Credit as a pay-as-you-go option to call and send SMS. If you call specific destinations, save even more with monthly subscriptions. Skype subscriptions are monthly calling plans that let you make unlimited or fixed-minute calls to landlines (and mobiles where applicable). Subscriptions begin at USD 2.99 a month for US and can vary by destination. To make an in-app purchase, open the app, go to the Call tab and tap on the Skype to Phone banner. Skype Credit and Subscriptions purchased from the Skype app will be charged to your iTunes account once the purchase has been confirmed.\n \nYour account will be charged for Skype subscription renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. Your subscription will be renewed automatically unless auto-renewal has been turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period of subscription.\n \nYou can manage your subscription by going to your Apple ID account settings and choosing the auto-renewal option or turning it off any time after your purchase.\n \n• Privacy and Cookies policy: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=507539\n• Microsoft Services Agreement: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=530144", "bundleId":"com.skype.skype", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2019-03-12T21:18:22Z", "averageUserRating":3.5, "userRatingCount":3722},

"description":"+++300MB VPN data for FREE!+++Best Online Game Accelerator+++Access VOIP & Facebook, YouTube, Hulu, Skype, Instagram, SnapChat, Netflix smoothly!+++Auto-setup all your devices (iPhone, iPad, iTouch)+++Servers in United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, France, Hong Kong and Germany!\n\nWHAT IS IT?\nVPN is a 128-bit encrypted tunnel between your device (computer, iPhone/iTouch/iPad) and one of our servers.\n\nWHY HAVE A VPN ACCOUNT?\nIf you want a total Internet traffic anonymizing experience, a VPN account is the best way to go - there’s no IP numbers to configure into the webapps, and no software to install - just set up the VPN and it’s done! Other features include, but are not limited to:\n\n- Use VOIP service from anywhere\n- Accelerate online games: get extremely low latency when playing Order & Chaos, MetalStorm online and etc.\n- Assigns your computer a new IP address, hides your real IP to anonymize all web applications.\n- A secure encrypted connection between your computer and the Internet.\n- Secure your wireless (Wi-Fi) connection at home or at public Hotspots.\n- Unlike a proxy, you get secured connection for all programs you are using, (e.g ICQ, Email, FTP, News and anything that uses a Internet Connection)\n\nWHY USE VPN EXPRESS FOR YOUR VPN SERVICES?\n- Support All VPN Protocols available in iOS devices: IPSec, L2TP over IPSec and PPTP!\n- Lowest Rates with 24x7 availability! 99% service up time! Beat any other competitors in market!\n- Optimized for iPhone/iPad/iTouch communication\n- Quality Network ensures your VPN service will be fast wherever you are in the world\n\nWHAT OUR CUSTOMERS SAY:\n+++++ Mar 2, 2012 by DrRhysB\n\"Excellent App! - I had tried several VPN plans before this & wasn't satisfied with the through-put consistency. VPN Express does exactly what, when, & how I need it for a very reasonable price. Best one out there!\"\n\n+++++ Jan 22, 2012 by Neil.D\n\"100% Perfect. 100% of the Time - This is the best VPN solution I have used. It's on my Mac, iPad and iPhone and can be used simultaneously! The pricing plans are awesome as well. Saves me a bundle.\"\n\n+++++ Jan 11, 2012 by Anthony Martinez\n\"Simple, efficient VPN. It just works. - Very easy to use with auto-configure setting. I use this all the time, and find it is great when traveling internationally or when I want greater wifi security in coffee shops. Recommended.\"\n\n+++++ Oct 17, 2011 by Computer Bear\n\"VPN Express - This app is great. Skype was blocked at the hospital where my son was in the NICU. My family and friends could not always travel the 150 mile round trip with us to see the baby. The hospitals IT director was asked to unblock Skype several times. He would not. With this app I went around the firewall. I highly recommend this app.\"", "bundleId":"com.bestsparks.vpnclient", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2016-08-31T11:40:33Z", "averageUserRating":4.5, "userRatingCount":96},

"description":"A smarter way to book a taxi! Book your cab with Skype to avoid the expense. Use SMS booking to save money and avoid language barriers when abroad. If we can't give you such options, plain old phone booking is of course available.\n\n*** Abroad and not having internet connection? \nWhere possible, Taxican will give you a choice of providers from its on-device database (60+ cities worldwide, growing every day) with hopefully SMS option to book.\n\n*** Have internet connection, but we don't have on-device provider handy?  \nUse built-in online search for a taxi, to book just in two taps. Stores the taxicab you found for you, so you can use it next time, either you are connected or not.\n\n*** Your favorite taxi is not in the online search or on-device list?\nJust add it. All of the booking options, phone, skype, sms are available here to use if provider supports them. No need to approve anything with anyone here. If you like sharing your favorite provider with others and Taxican team, please do. Within a day we add it, so all Taxican users can use it.\n\n*** In a restaurant/office and gps is not really helpful finding your pickup address?\nTaxican integrates with Foursquare to bring you the list of pickup location candidates closest to you. You bet there is a chance the restaurant or your office will be on the list, thus giving you and a taxi driver a perfect pickup address.\n\n*** Booked for few days in advance and can't remember if booked or for when and with whom exactly?\nHistory of last 10 bookings is kept for your convenience. With pickup location if entered, pickup time, taxi provider name and city, just in case! As we are getting older at Taxican this becomes our favorite feature :).\n\n*** A word of disclaimer and encouragement\nWe will try to do our best to find your a taxi with the least expense and hurdle. Though we are just starting and your suggestions for new taxis and improvements will be greatly appreciated.", "bundleId":"com.taxican.taxiglobal", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2011-10-05T19:38:28Z"},

"description":"Boost your iPhone with CallingCredit!\n\n\n- Cheap or even FREE calls to countries across the world!\n- Easy to use!\n- Perfect sound quality!\n\nCallingCredit will help you save dramatically on your international calls, without changing the way you use your iPhone. \n\nHow does CallingCredit achieve this? Well, CallingCredit for iPhone allows your phone to access the CallingCredit system through a local access number. If you have a contract with your mobile operator, calls to the CallingCredit access number will be included within your regular monthly calling plan. If you are a pay-as-you go customer, your mobile operator will only charge you the cost of a local call. \n\nOnce your call has reached the CallingCredit access number, CallingCredit takes care of connecting the call at incredibly low rates.   \n\nTo benefit from the CallingCredit system, you need to have your mobile phone number listed in your CallingCredit account. \n\nIf you do not have an account, sign up here: http://www.callingcredit.com\n\nCallingCredit website \nhttp://www.callingcredit.com\n\nContact CallingCredit Support \nsupport@callingcredit.com", "bundleId":"com.5Pro-Software.CallingCredit", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2010-10-29T08:26:10Z"},

"description":"**UPDATE** PocketCam now supports audio! Support for FaceTime, iChat/Messages on macs added!\n\n** YouTube Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A69c4HHok3U\n\n** IMPORTANT ** Please turn off Bluetooth on the device (Settings->General->Bluetooth) before using PocketCam. Otherwise, you may experience frame drops/freeze. \n\nWhy paying for an expensive webcam when you can use your awesome iOS device for video conference?  Better yet, your iOS webcam is wireless!  Now you can use your iOS device to show around your house/apartment on your favorite webcam applications such as FaceTime, iChat/Messages, Windows Live or Skype.\n\nPocketCam lets you use your iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad as a wireless webcam (and microphone!) for your Windows-based computer or Mac (OS X 10.7 or above). PocketCam automatically forwards video captured by your iOS camera, which can then be used as if they come from a virtual webcam.\n\nPocketCam works with any Windows-based webcam or video conferencing applications, including instant message applications such as MSN Live Messenger, Skype, AIM, etc.  For Mac users, PocketCam works with any Mac applications that use QuickTime for video capturing, including FaceTime, iChat/Messages, GTalk, Skype and aMSN.\n\nYou can even record the live video from your iOS cam using a webcam recorder such as QuickTime Pro.\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1.  If you have not already done so, download and install the PocketControl for Windows or Mac software from our website: http://www.senstic.com/iPhone/PocketCam/PocketCam.aspx\n\n2.  On Windows, run PocketControl for Windows and make sure the PocketCam service is running on your computer.  On Mac, run PocketControl, and run any application that uses webcam and select PocketCam as your preferred webcam.\n\n3.  Start PocketCam on iOS device, and the app will automatically connect to your computer. The bottom of your iOS screen should display \"Connected to your_computer_name:port.\"\n\n4.  Start any program on your computer that uses webcam, and select \"PocketCam\" as your virtual webcam.\n\nEnjoy live feed from your iOS camera as your webcam source!\n\nStep-by-step instructions can be found at http://www.senstic.com/iphone/pocketcam/Support.aspx\n\nLIMITATIONS:\n\n1.

This really works and immediately gets kids back on track so you won't have to call Santa about them being naughty again!\n\n3) SANTA VOICE MAIL:  Santa answers his video phone with his cheery \"outgoing message\", saying he's sorry he missed your call!

"description":"WiFi on your iPhone or laptop, anywhere, anytime. Makayama has teamed up with Hotspotr.com and Free-hotspot.com to provide you with data around the world. In the US and Europe, there's a hotspot on almost every streetcorner. This app helps you find them quickly, using the built-in GPS of the iPhone. \n\nThe software leads you to the nearest of 100,000 wireless hotspots, in 15,000 cities and 132 countries, with the touch of a button. It's WiFi for Dummies. Get your mail and browse the web without being charged. The ideal WiFi-tool for frequent travellers and mobile professionals. \n\nThe app shows you the nearest free hotspot address, provides directions on Google Maps, and shows additional information, such as the hotspot provider, phone number and website. You can browse the full database manually by country and city, or choose to automatically show results based on your location.\n\nThe application doesn’t depend on WLAN scanning, which would limit the range to only 25 yards, but uses GPS to pinpoint all known hotspots up to 10 miles away. All the wireless accesspoints are locally stored on your iPhone, and GPS usage is also offline available, so no expensive data roaming is needed. When abroad, you save hundreds of dollars in roaming cost, because you will always find a broadband data connection for your laptop and iPhone.\n\nThis app will let you get your mail or surf the web as quickly as possible. Just run it and it'll connect you for to the internet. It doesn't get easier than this. \n\nPlease note: Does NOT work on iPod Touch because it has no GPS.", "bundleId":"com.makayama.FreeWifi", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2018-11-24T20:42:53Z", "averageUserRating":1.0, "userRatingCount":6},
