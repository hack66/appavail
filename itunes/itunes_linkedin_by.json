"description":"Eight is the ultimate business card organizer and professional networking platform. Used by over 2 million people, Eight is an easy, convenient & completely free-to-use app.\n\nSimply scan in any visiting cards you receive, and see them instantly put into a digital business cards holder. Eight uses a proprietary combination of OCR technology & human input to accurately digitize each card into a unique Eight profile, giving users a convenient database of their professional network with 99.9% accuracy!\n\nEight is also a powerful professional network and enables you to network with scanned business cards on the app. From a contact's profile, you can call, email, or view their address on a map. Eight users can share news & updates with their Eight network or even interact with each other through instant messages. \n\nWhy Eight?\n-\tIt scans business cards with 99.9% accuracy using both OCR & human transcription thus helping users to manage contacts and stay linked in conveniently and easily.\n-\tThe standard version is free and includes scanning, organizing features. \n-\tUsers can purchase Eight Premium for quicker digitization and more benefits.\n-\tUsers can sync their networks to their devices. Data is also automatically updated if connected contacts change the details on their business card.\n\nWhat Eight has in store for you:\n\n- Organize business cards & professional networks: \nUsers often have a large stack of disorganized visiting cards & biz cards making them difficult to use and refer to. Eight is a free digital card holder that solves this problem by removing the need for manual entry. Now using your mobile cam, cards will be instantly digitized into an e visiting card, and you will be able to see full information of the card on the app. Additionally, once digitized, Eight lets users add notes & tags on profiles so they can manage contacts & organize their business & professional network efficiently. It's a digital card scanner, holder, reader & organizer consolidated in a single app.\n\n- Manual input to ensure superior accuracy: \nEight uses a combination of OCR technology & human resources to digitize business cards from a scanned image into a digital Eight profile. After users scan their biz cards, Eight uses OCR technology to instantly read the data on the visiting cards, which is then manually checked & corrected by our team, ensuring 99.9% accuracy even for the most hard-to-read cards. It's a perfect digital card maker as it easily converts visiting cards to e biz cards.\n\n- Easy search feature to find & reach contacts from within the app: \nThis is not your regular visiting cards scanner or digital business card holder. It allows users to manage contacts & contact them via email or phone, helping them unlock new business & career opportunities. It is especially helpful for salespeople and salesforce users to manage & convert leads.\n\n- Free to use basic app with an option to buy premium features: \nThe standard version of the app is free to use and has all the essential functions that make Eight a powerful business solution. Users can purchase Eight Premium for additional benefits including an ability to export their data (e.g. phonebook sync). It not only helps users to convert their visiting cards & biz cards into e business cards using OCR but also lets them export their e business card data to their devices.\n\n- Networking: Eight stands out among others as it not only scans your business cards but also lets you stay linked in with your contacts who are themselves Eight users, by providing options such as private instant chat messaging and an activity feed thus providing you with ample business opportunities and timely updates from your network.\n\nHow does Eight compare to alternatives?\nCamcard: Camcard and most other scanners only uses OCR, not human input, causing significantly lower accuracy.\nBric: Bric and others have scan limits, following which you have to pay. Eight is totally free and unlimited.", "bundleId":"net.8card.eight", "minimumOsVersion":"10.0"},

"releaseNotes":"• In order to improve security and address user feedback, Kalido no longer automatically adds users as your contacts based on phone book data\n• Now you’ll see a “My Personal Network” network, which lets you individually manage your personal connections by sending and accepting requests\n• When expanding your personal network, you can now search for anyone in your existing networks, and anyone else who has chosen to be findable on Kalido, and request to add them. Once you’ve made a request, and the other person has accepted, they will be part of your personal network\n• In Settings, you can manage your search visibility, to choose whether anyone can find you, or only people in your networks\n• We have replaced the default public environment that all users previously belonged to with a set of geographic networks: These networks are automatically created for countries, cities, and neighbourhoods where Kalido users are active. Anyone can join these networks, allowing everyone an easy way to understand the communities around them. For companies and schools, this also means that during onboarding, a user can choose to join only your private network, creating the option of a completely private Kalido experience for them from Day One\n• Private network admins can now specify an email domain (e.g. my company.com) that will allow anyone with an @mycompany.com email address to automatically join a specific private network\n• When signing up, in addition to adding any custom skill you want, we’ve made it easier to select skills you have, and skills you are looking for, from a curated list\n• When signing up,  we now suggest people that you might know, to make building your personal network easier\n• To improve navigation, the bottom tab bar is now visible at all times, unless you are in an uninterruptible flow (e.g. when recommending someone, introducing someone, or adding a skill, search or interest to your profile). This means you can now navigate into a screen within the Networks tab, and still have one-tap access to the Nearby tab, for example.\n• Our matching AI has learned to be better and faster, so now you'll get higher quality matches in less time across a broader set of skill concepts\n• Improved performance for chat, matching, network, and nearby views, making it easier to interact with networks that have thousands of members\n• More than 100 small bug fixes and minor experience improvements across the board", "formattedPrice":"Free", "releaseDate":"2015-10-29T14:19:21Z", "primaryGenreName":"Business", "primaryGenreId":6000, "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2019-03-13T12:58:11Z", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "sellerName":"OM Mobile Ventures LLC", "currency":"USD", "wrapperType":"software", "version":"1.65", "trackId":961851767, "trackName":"Kalido: Business Network, Jobs", "artistId":961851766, "artistName":"Om Mobile Ventures", "genres":["Business", "Social Networking"], "price":0.00, 
"description":"Your network is one of your most valuable assets. At its full potential, it can unlock a whole world of opportunities. But if you’re like most people, building, maintaining, and getting value from your networks is hard. You are surrounded by opportunities: but to capture them, you need a way to see them. Kalido works constantly to help you uncover opportunities to use your skills; find people who have skills you need; and expand your network in ways that create value for you and the people you add.\n\nThis empowers you to offer skills and services, find skilled professionals and meet potential clients, with trust at the core of every interaction. Simply by responding to two simple prompts “I want to meet…” and “I can provide…” and sharing your contacts, you unleash the power of Kalido to find unique and trusted matches for you.\n\nKalido drives incredible networking value for enterprises, schools, conference organisers and attendees.  For enterprises: Kalido enables better onboarding for new joiners (including temporary hires like freelancers and consultants). For schools, Kalido allows alumni to stay connected wherever they are in the world, hire each other more easily, and get introductions and referrals to trusted and skilled people through a community they trust. For conference organisers, attendees find live networking opportunities through immediate matching and browsing, so they can meet, converse and exchange value in minutes.  For everyone else, Kalido removes the middleman, and replaces anonymous reviews with trusted recommendations.\n\nKalido acts as your marketplace for people.  It will find you an awesome local web designer, it will allow you to introduce your friend, who is a freelance photographer, to your private trusted network of local entrepreneurs. It will allow you to make money from your hobby and introduce you to people looking for your skills. Kalido will tell you when a friend or colleague is nearby so you can catch up for that overdue coffee which may lead to a big career opportunity you hadn’t even thought of. It will do all of this, perpetually, infinitely, daily. For free.\n\nWe believe that there should be a level playing field and people should have the environment to create opportunity for themselves no matter who they are.  That’s why we built Kalido.\n\n● Nearby: You are surrounded by talented individuals who can offer useful skills, and Kalido can help you discover them. More importantly, it can help you be discovered too, maybe for local jobs or freelance opportunities. No matter where you are in the world Kalido will tell you who’s around.\n\n● Networks: Join networks to see and match with relevant people nearby, wherever you are in the world. Search and share opportunities with fellow alumni and colleagues. Meet up, chat with, and get introductions to new business clients, professionals, or other alumni. Create your own customised and secure private network and invite colleagues and friends to join.\n\n● Introductions: Do you have a connection who needs to hire a photographer for an upcoming project? Perhaps your friend is a freelance photographer? Why not introduce them to each other online? Kalido gives you the ability to refer and be referred because everybody knows someone.\n\n● Chat: Call, text, or meet up with your matches and trusted contacts directly. Use pre-defined icebreakers to help you get things off the ground and network.\n\n● Trusted matches: we match you with the right people, enabling freelancers to meet new clients, start networking, outsource and succeed in their career. We prioritize matches who have shared contacts, shared networks and are nearby.\n\n● Offer freelancing services: we provide business and job opportunities to freelancers and small businesses to offer their services. Freelancers can meet professional clients who value their work and get jobs at a fair price. Kalido will be your online cv to showcase your skills and experience.", "bundleId":"net.ommobile.samui", "minimumOsVersion":"10.0"},

The first week is for MONITORING: you should access normally Social Media via the Launcher Screen of TEN to give the app initial data to work on.\n2. From week 2 the app will show you how many accesses you have left in order to achieve your (weekly-10%) goal.\n\nFeatures:\n• Open your Social Networks directly from the Launcher screen (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Linkedin)\n• Track how many times you access every app\n• See how many accesses you have left to achieve your goals\n• Control your progress with Analytics data\n\nThe success of this technique depends only on YOU and on your willingness to improve your life!\nTEN is just a tool to let you be aware of the problem and support you in the achievement of your goals.\n\nSuggestion: Hide your Social Networks app inside a folder and always remember to access them from TEN.\n\nUse it responsibly :D\n\n\n\n\n*Icons made by http://www.freepik.com", "bundleId":"com.r4id4.ten", "minimumOsVersion":"11.0"},

Skupiamy się na tym jak genialne umiejętności mają ludzie wokół nas.\n\nPrzykład 1. Masz w firmie kolegę... wiesz jak się nazywa i czym się zajmuje w pracy ale nie wiesz, że po godzinach ten miły młody człowiek ubabrany smarem z pasją naprawia stare motocykle.\n\nPrzykład 2. Znasz swojego lekarza pediatrę, bo on leczy Twoje dzieci ale nie masz pojęcia, że to pasjonat rowerowy, który po godzinach - dzień w dzień - robi blisko 50 kilometrów na rowerze jeżdżąc po lesie a w dodatku praktykuje jogę. Tak jak Ty.\n\nPrzykład 3. Masz w pracy informatyka? Na pewno. A tu nagle okazuje się, że ten chłopak w weekendy genialnie tańczy salsę a w lato wymiata na wake’u. Fascynujące, prawda? Ale Ty o tym dotąd nie wiedziałeś.\n\nDowiesz się tego dzięki IcanDO. Buduj z nami społeczność ludzi, którzy dzielą się tym co potrafią robić - społeczność ludzi, których łączą umiejętności.\n\nAplikacja jest bezpłatna i nie wyświetla reklam.", "bundleId":"pl.icando.icando", "minimumOsVersion":"8.0"},

Your next producer, director, writer, investor, co-founder, employer could be the person in front of you in line at your next coffee stop.\n\nWhy we do this:\nIn a world of constantly evolving technology created to over simplify our lives, we have ironically felt more isolated despite the growing number of platforms designed to “connect” us.  We’re the ones who follow our passion doing what we love 24/7 and are most likely reading this on our phone.  Our worst nightmare is going to work in a suit for 40 hours/week for the next 40 years.  Kill me now.   And don‘t dare leave me a voicemail – just text me.  Today, meeting strangers online has become the norm but connecting in person devolved into a “soft-skill,” surfacing a host of anxieties in our wifi-raised generation.  \n\nWe share everything from office space to cars to even our homes.  We can work in our sweats half way across the world and use our social media for new business deals because work bleeds into our social lives; as it should, because, when you love what you do - it’s not work.  We don't waste our lives looking forward to the weekend because every day is the weekend.  We’re out and about every day and night taking action to turn our fantasies into a reality.   We know that it’s not just “who you know” but who likes and trusts you.  So we’re always trying to meet the right people in hopes that we may one day work together and inspire the world.   But, how on earth do we meet the right people? \n\nAt Renge, we believe you are always\nin the right place\nat the right time\nwith the right people. \n\nSee Who’s Here", "bundleId":"com.rengeinc.renge", "minimumOsVersion":"12.1"},

Approximately 100 billion cards are printed globally each year, consuming 6 million trees. That’s about the equivalent of San Francisco in forest area that is cut each year, just to make business cards that are thrown out.\n\nSalut will help you go completely paper-less and digitize your business cards. You can easily create a card in less than five minutes and include all relevant business information like email, LinkedIn profile, Instagram page, website and much more. \n\nYou can then share this card with anyone, using a QR code or email invite. The receiver does not need to have Salut installed, instead they can view your Salut card as an email or web version on any device. \n\nFinally, you can keep track of all your contacts inside the app. Contacts are updated in real time so if somebody changes their phone number, it will also be updated in your app. \n\n\n***What people say about Salut***\n\n\"Since we have sustainability deeply incorporated in our core values, we've decided not to use business cards in our company anymore. Therefore, Salut solution helps me in many ways in my business life. It allows me to manage all my contacts from fairs, business meetings and everyday life at one place.
