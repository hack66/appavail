Anytime, anywhere.\nGrizzly-grade security: TunnelBear uses strong AES-256 bit encryption by default. Weaker encryption isn’t even an option.\nNo logging. Your browsing stays private.\nHelpful support that always responds within 24 hours.\n\nWHAT CRITICS ARE SAYING\n“TunnelBear is an elegant, easy mobile VPN that keeps you safe.”\n- Lifehacker\n\n“The app is bursting with charm, but it also delivers security at a good price.”\n- PCMag\n\n“All you have to do is turn the switch to “ON” and you are protected.”\n- WSJ\n\n“TunnelBear, the gorgeous VPN app that wants to bring online privacy to everyone.”\n- VentureBeat\n\nPRIVACY POLICY:\n*Spoiler alert* TunnelBear has a strict no-logging policy.

Moreover your connection is encrypted.\n- ISPs and insecure wireless networks won't see your browsing. It will be difficult for anybody to trace your internet activities back to your device.\n- You will be able to access .onion websites which are only accessible through the TOR network.\n- Advanced browsing capability with tabs, and popover detection and blocking.\n- You can automatically delete cookies, cache and third party data on application exit.\n- Support for audio and video playback.\n- Easy to use interface: just one button to connect to the closest server!\n\nIf you purchase our Premium subscription you will also be able to enjoy the following advanced features:\n- Ads-Free experience.\n- Unlimited VPN Session duration.\n- Priority Support.\n \nVPN + TOR is the allay for data safety you can trust. Download it now and secure your mobile browser: it's fast and easy, you just need to tap a button to enjoy full anonymity.

A Proxy server is, however, completely browser-based, and might not be compatible with certain web pages that use non-browser technology. Unlike a Proxy, a VPN service encrypts all your traffic and will work with all internet based services. In summary, VPN will provide you with more online privacy and security.\n\nWith Touch VPN you can：\n\n* When you’re connected to a public Wi-Fi Hotspot, your name, passwords, and personal information can be easily compromised.

The button connects you to one of many servers at speeds faster than a web proxy. When you are not running our app we help you save your device's battery.\n\n* Surf the Web Privately.  Your real IP address is concealed and your internet activity is inaccessible to prying eyes and businesses.\n\n--------------\n\nSubscription:\n\nYou can be an Elite user through auto-renewable subscription.

"description":"• #1 ad blocking solution for iOS\n• Over 750 000 app downloads worldwide\n• No in-app purchases, no subscription. Simple one-time payment\n• Top Utility ranked in all App Stores around the world \n• Over 1000+ carefully crafted filters\n• Easy setup in under 1 minute with detailed tutorial\n• Now with built-in Safari Content Blocker for better web ad protection\n\nWeblock allows you to control how your device fetches online content. Easily manage PAC (Proxy Auto-Config) script and route different connections through different proxy servers. Weblock can make your device download ads (banners and popups), stats and user tracking, scripts or images through a proxy server you pick. It also allows you to use a different proxy for specific websites, like Facebook, Twitter, Google+, social widgets from websites. You can even define your own content filters. With Weblock you can control proxy for basically any network resource! This way you can choose not to reveal your real IP to different services, limit advanced ad targeting and protect your privacy.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICE: You're responsible for selecting a proxy server that allows you to download content you wish to download. We DO NOT provide a proxy service. Using a bad proxy server (like 127.0.0.1:8021) might result in some resources being blocked. You can control your proxy settings selectively with Weblock. Contact our support if you need help choosing right proxy server or setting up Weblock on your device.\n\nHere are some situations in which Weblock might come in handy:\n• Fetch ads through a proxy server you choose. Protect your privacy and prevent ad servers from knowing your real IP address and tracking you.\n• Disable majority of ads on websites you visit on your iOS device! Weblock supports all major web browsers: Safari, Chrome, Mercury and others (browsers redirecting web traffic through third-party servers like Puffin Browser or Opera Mini are not be supported).\n• Easily remove all native Facebook widgets and plugins (Like buttons, comments, etc.) on sites you visit - simply disable Facebook plugins in Weblock! Do the same for Twitter, Google+ and other social media.\n• Stop annoying Tapatalk popups, nagging you to download forum browsing app on every visit.\n• Take control of someone else's device - you can preconfigure any iOS device to control it with your Weblock app. Block or redirect any content, anytime, directly from your own device.\n• Your predefined filters and custom rules can be synced between all your iOS devices using iCloud.\n• If you wish to block something else, you can create your own rules and filters. You can block any URL (with regular expressions), domain or IP address. Don't know how? Let us know - we're here for you.\n• You can also use Weblock's redirect feature to emulate '/etc/hosts' entries for HTTP and HTTPS traffic. This might be useful for web and app developers to pin domains to different IP addresses.\n\n••• IMPORTANT! •••\nNeed help setting up Weblock?

Hi VPN masks your IP address, encrypts your Internet traffic, protects your privacy with a secure connection on public Wi-Fi so that you can access any content safely and anonymously.\n\nWhy Choose Hi VPN?\n\n• Hi VPN is extremely fast, and especially secure.\n• Large number of servers covering all around the world.\n• All-new designed app with an unprecedented smooth experience.\n• Intelligently choose the fastest and highest quality server.\n• Hi VPN has no limit on traffic and usage time at all.\n• No need to register or login, no account required.\n• No tracking of your network access, no log storage.\n• No additional permissions required.\n• Hi VPN works with Wi-Fi, LTE, 3G, and all mobile cellular data carriers.\n\nInstall Hi VPN Now You Can:\n\n► Stay anonymous online and protect privacy\n\nUsing Hi VPN, your IP and location will be masked and your activities can no longer be tracked on the Internet. Hi VPN is fully committed to your Internet privacy and keeps no logs of your activity, even if someone requests the data of our VPN service users, we have none to provide.\n\n► Secure your device and your mobile data\n\nHi VPN secures your device’s connection while you’re connected to public Wi-Fi hotspots or cellular data networks.

(Free VPN version may show some ads. Upgrade to Hi VPN Premium to enjoy ad-free VPN, if you prefer.)\n\nWhat is a VPN and Why Would I Need One?\n\nA VPN, or Virtual Private Network, allows you to create a secure connection to another network over the Internet. VPNs can be used to shield your browsing activity from prying eyes on public Wi-Fi, and more.\n\nIn very simple terms, a VPN connects your PC, smartphone, or tablet to another computer (called a server) somewhere on the internet, and allows you to browse the internet using that computer’s internet connection. So if that server is in a different country, it will appear as if you are coming from that country, and you can potentially access things that you couldn’t normally.\n\nThe vast majority of people these days are using VPN. They are still very useful for protecting yourself while working at a coffee shop, but that’s hardly the primary use anymore.\n\nHi VPN Premium service includes:\n\n• 3-day free trial: free of charge; no commitment; cancel anytime.\n• Price of subscription: one-year plan: $3.99/mo; 6-month plan: $5.33/mo; monthly plan: $7.99/mo.\n• Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n• Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n• Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal.\n• Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.\n• Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nTerms of Use: http://bit.ly/HiVPNTerms\nPrivacy Policy: http://bit.ly/HiVPNPrivacy\n\nCopyright © 2019 Hi Security Lab.

"description":"Everything on your iPhone or iPad uses the internet. Your email apps, web browsers, photo apps, banking apps, chat and social apps. \n\nHaving secure internet access is critical and wifi routers are hacked every day. VPN Freely will encrypt your internet traffic preventing WiFi hackers from collecting data mid-stream. It can also help you access sites that may otherwise be blocked.\n\nVPN Freely is the easiest way to secure your iPhone/iPad wifi & cellular internet activity. By simply clicking the \"Secure Me\" button you will be connected to our ultra secure Virtual Private Network. While connected you can safely surf the web, shop online and use banking apps without worry.\n\nStay Connected. Stay Safe.\n\nWhat's so great about VPN Freely?\n\n- Free iOS VPN for iPhone and iPad\n- Stealth Mode **NEW**\n- WiFi Hotspot Security\n- One Click Instant Access to Connect (No Sign-Up Required)\n- No Email, Names or Phone Numbers Required\n- 256 bit Bank Grade VPN Server Encryption\n- No Server Logs or Activity Tracking\n- We never sell user data. None of it. Ever.\n- Your internet traffic will travel over our secure IP similar to a Proxy\n- Encrypt the internet connection to your web browsers and mobile apps\n- No daily limits on usage\n- No data limits on streaming and downloads\n- Built on servers trusted by millions\n- Double the speed of your Free account by subscribing to our Newsletter\n\nAbout our Premium iOS VPN Service Subscriptions:\n\n- Go Premium to remove your speed limits and stop ads\n- Go Premium to remove the 30min session timeout \n- Go Premium to use Stealth Mode\n- Premium subscriptions are tied to your Apple ID. You can use one subscription on up to 5 devices as long as they're using the same Apple ID. After you go Premium simply use the \"Restore Purchase\" option on your additional devices (using the same Apple ID) to make them Premium also.\n- We do offer Free Trials of the Premium version from time to time. These are offered to Free users via popup message in the app.\n- At the end of your trial the auto-renew subscription for Monthly Premium VPN service will start\n- Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n- Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Subscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a Premium subscription\n\nNow for a lesson in security.\n\nWhat is \"WiFi Hotspot Security\" anyway?\n\nWiFi is everywhere now and if we can save our cellular data even just a little bit, we want to connect. However, just because your phone wants to connect to a WiFi hotspot doesn't mean it's safe. The fact is your phone can't tell you if the hotspot is safe or not. \n\nIf the hotspot is not secure other people online may be able to see your internet activity. Hackers love to sniff data on coffee shop WiFi networks because the customers feel comfortable there just like it's home. If the customer is comfortable they'll do things like personal banking online. This is why no public WiFi connection should be trusted.\n\nThe Solution = VPN Freely\n\nIt's so easy! One simple rule...\n\nAfter connecting to a Public WiFi Hotspot. Always, open your iPhone VPN Freely app (or iPad) and click \"Secure Me\". \n\nJust like that your internet access is encrypted and secured. It really is easy to surf the web safely. \n\nDownload VPN Freely today! \n\nDon't forget to try our Premium iOS VPN upgrade for free!\n\nWebsite: http://vpnfreely.com\nPrivacy Policy:  http://vpnfreely.com/privacy\nTerms of Service:  http://vpnfreely.com/terms\n\nNeed help?

"description":"Private Internet Access VPN\n\nProtect your privacy with Private Internet Access®, the world's leading VPN service for iOS users on iPhone and iPad. Private Internet Access®, or PIA, enables users to encrypt their network traffic and stay protected when online with our proxy servers. Add privacy and security to private and public networks when you browse the Internet and use WiFi, whether connected to a hotspot or at home. High speeds, unlimited bandwidth, connect with 5 devices simultaneously (smartphones, tablets, computers), no traffic logs, and 24/7 professional, native English speaking customer support.\n\nWHY USE VPN FROM PRIVATE INTERNET ACCESS®?\n\n• Low price. $3.33 per month if you purchase a yearly account ($39.99/year) or $6.99 on a monthly basis.\n• Reliable and trusted VPN provider since 2010 with a proven no log policy.\n• Privacy is our Policy. Here at PIA, we not only provide a great VPN service at a low price, but we also support organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, FightForTheFuture, Creative Commons, Open Rights Group, Index on Censorship, freenode, Wireguard, Arch Linux, and many others.\n\nWe respect your privacy and anonymity.\n\nBY USING VPN FROM PRIVATE INTERNET ACCESS®, YOU GET:\n\n• IP Cloaking. Your IP address will be changed to a Private Internet Access IP address to hide your identity and location. Hide your IP address to stop data trackers, snoopers, and hackers from tracking your browsing and search activity.\n\n• Data Encryption. Encrypt your internet traffic with our VPN proxy. Our trusted online privacy service creates several security layers which keep you anonymous and prevent access to your data. It’s time to change your WiFi habits. Don’t use WiFi without our secure VPN to proxy your internet traffic!\nWiFi Security. With WPA and WPA2 now kracked, you need a VPN to protect your WiFi everywhere - not just in hotspots, coffee shops, cafes, hotels, and airports. If you use WiFi hotspots without encryption, your data can be seen, blocked, throttled, censored, or otherwise changed.\n\n• Content Blocker. The Safari Content Blocker blocks ads, trackers, and malware while browsing with Safari.\n\nWHAT DO OUR CUSTOMERS THINK?\n\n“Firstly, the company is second to none in terms of support, troubleshooting, and individualized assistance. Their nodes and hubs are top speed. Their client is streamlined and has a tremendous ease of use.”\nJAYDLUV, 10/10/2017\n\n“This is my go to app for VPN. Been using Windows version for years and the iPad version is great.”\nPkcarreon, 09/18/2017\n\n“No hiccups, no crashes or anything. It just works great. Bear in mind you have to subscribe to the service for this to work. I highly recommend it.”\nScott Loflin, 09/15/2017\n\n“Simple and solid. No issues even when traveling.”\nJoe1134206, 09/8/2017\n\n“Love it. Feel safer when browsing the internet.”\nCachuco, 08/7/2017\n\n“Hard to find a nit with this app. (...) The iOS app allows a quicker toggle on/off than digging into settings, for VPN hostile iOS apps like Pandora and Netflix. I like PIA’s value for the money, and I have not had any trouble whatsoever with the iOS app. I recommend this app, and PIA, as one of your layers of online security.”\nDB Associates, 01/27/2017\n\n“I did my homework, reviewing many VPN services. PIA was among the most economical, plenty of simultaneous connections and more than enough servers and services. (...) The speed is more than I hoped for. I can stream all YouTube videos. HD quality is superb with no buffering. I am happy to have this extra security on all our devices. My wife could not tell the difference after I installed it on her PC. I think I paid $39.99/year. What a bargain!”\nHelmut, 06/20/2016\n\nGDPR compatibility\n\nThis application only sends username and encrypted passwords to our servers as part of using this app. During signups, we also collect user's email. We do not collect and/or store any other user information.", "bundleId":"com.privateinternetaccess.ios.PIA-VPN", "genreIds":["6007", "6002"]},

"description":"The iOS comes with built-in HTTP proxy, anyone who needs them can easily find these setting in system preference. However, there still comes a tiny flaw: HTTP proxy can't be used under 4G.\nAnother concern of this app is the PAC (proxy auto-config) files. In most situation, one PAC file will be enough, but when you need multiple PAC files from multiple different resources, the user may have to learn how to merge them, make the situation even worse.\nSo here comes the solution: Filter proxy! It allows you to use HTTP proxy under 4G, make it a quite handy tool for iOS developers, especially when developers are trying to debug behavior specific to 4G. It also allows you to use multiple PAC files as rules, only the rule matched first get the chance to decide which proxy to go.\nBest of all, this app will capture absolute zero data from you - and you can verify that by download source code from https://github.com/cnnblike/discord. So there will be absolute no concern about privacy!", "bundleId":"com.cnnblike.discord", "genreIds":["6002"]},

"description":"IntelliVPN is a VPN service that uses the IPSec / IKEv2 protocol and bank-level encryption. VPN service provides encryption of traffic, which ensures the security of the data you transmit through public networks, such as public Wi-Fi.\n\nIntelliVPN gives you access to VPN servers in over 20+ regions around the world.\n\nYour provider cannot track or restrict your online activity.  All resources you visit (websites, social media, etc.) will see IP addresses of our VPN servers instead of your IP.\n\nWhy IntelliVPN?\n\na. Bank-level encryption (AES-256)\n\nIntelliVPN uses a 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm that ensures your personal data protection. It is impossible to tap your data; hackers or fraudsters have no chance to access it. It is of primary importance when using public Wi-Fi access points in airports and metro, cafes and restaurants, hotels and malls or in other potentially dangerous networks.\n\nb. Absolute anonymity in the Internet\n\nIntelliVPN hides your actions and location from service providers, website administrators, search engines, and fraudsters. All of them see the IP-address of our server instead of your personal one. That makes it impossible to detect your actual location and name of your Internet provider based on IP.\n\nc. No restrictions\n\nIntelliVPN has no restrictions on the speed or volume of transmitted data. Communicate in social networks, listen to music and watch films and series without being concerned about Internet traffic.\n\nd. Access to Tor network\n\nIntelliVPN provides access to Tor network and transparent access to .onion sites without the need for the use of specialised browsers.\n\n=== Premium ===\n\nTo gain access to an extended list of ultra fast servers and priority technical support, you can subscribe to the Premium version.\nPremium available via auto-renewable subscription. We offer following subscription options:\n\n- One month for $4.99\n- One year for $44.99\n\nAll subscription options include 3-days trial period\n\n=== Subscription details ===\n\nA subscription will renew at the end of each month unless cancelled.\n\n- Payments will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n- An account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours priority to end of current period.\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.\n- No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during an active subscription period.\n\n=== Feedback ===\n\nIf you have comments or questions about IntelliVPN, please send them to us at support@intellivpn.net.\n\nWe are also on Twitter: @IntelliVPN\n\nOur privacy policy: https://intellivpn.net/privacy_privacy.html\nTerms of service: https://intellivpn.net/terms_of_service.html", "bundleId":"net.intellivpn.ios", "genreIds":["6007", "6002"]},

Flash browsing support\n- Photon Browser allows you to play Flash games such as free Facebook games, use Flash apps and watch Flash video inline using its remote cloud browse mode.\n- Browse Flash websites that would otherwise not display on the iPhone.\n- Play music that streams through a Flash player.\n- Read news that require Flash support.\n- Press the “Lightning” icon on the bottom right navigation bar when you encounter a Flash website on the iPhone or iPod Touch.\n- Combines fast native browsing for normal websites and remote browsing for Flash websites. Switch between the 2 modes using the lightning bolt button (for Flash) or the web globe button (for native browsing).\n- Support different mode such as pointer mode for precision that makes your iPhone acts like a mouse pad. Supports touch mode for scrolling and touch/click. Supports drag mode for dragging around game maps.\n- Zoom in flash. PLEASE WAIT a second or two for the zoom to update before zooming again on iPhone and iPod touches.\n- We support audio. PLEASE MAKE sure your mute switch is not on.\n\n2. Fully featured powerful browser\n- Private browsing clears history, cookies and caches upon browser exit.\n- Anonymous browsing through our servers.\n- Share content via email.\n- Brightness control for night time browsing.\n- Rotation lock for playing web based games.\n- Personalize your browser by choosing from thousands of colors.\n\n3. Others\n- Bookmarks support\n- Print web pages using AirPrint.\n- More innovative features to come\n\nImportant notes - PLEASE READ BEFORE BUYING:\n- When you encounter a Flash website, REMEMBER TO CLICK ON the \"Lightning Bolt\" button to enter Flash streaming mode. Otherwise, you will see the standard Adobe message that Flash needs to be installed or upgraded as you are still in the native browser mode. Only by explicitly clicking on the \"Lightning\" button will you then be able to view Flash content.\n\n- If you have a slow Internet connection such as over a slow 3G network, remote browsing feature may have slow performance even though we have made great technological improvements to support Flash over low bandwidth. Flash mode works best over Wifi in a broadband network. Just because you have Wifi does not mean you have a fast network. Wifi is fast enough but your bottleneck is the wired connection that your Wifi sits on. However, you can still use Photon as a fast native browser for your regular browsing.\n\n- If you have problems, do not hesitate to contact us given in the support link on iTunes. We are extremely responsive and answer questions within 1-3 business days. For terms, please go to www.appsverse.com/Terms", "bundleId":"com.appsverse.browseriphone", "genreIds":["6002", "6007"]},
