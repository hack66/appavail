"description":"OpenSignal is the ultimate signal toolkit that shows you how to get a better network connection instantly, find nearby free Wifi hotspots worldwide, view signal maps so that you can compare performance of networks in your area and test the speed of your mobile or Wifi connection. \n\nUnlike other apps, which look for maximum possible speed through optimized testing, OpenSignal informs you about your true speed - what you are likely to experience when normally using your phone. Anyone using the app contributes data, informing others about real-world, not estimated, mobile performance (and we'll never ask you for personal information, just your signal strength stats).\n\nWith OpenSignal you can map cellular coverage, find Wi-Fi hotspots, test and improve your reception & get faster data.\n\n- Signal compass points you in the direction your signal is coming from \n- Speed test for download, upload and latency\n- Map of cell towers and Wifi hotspots\n- Coverage maps allow you see the best/worst places for 2G, 3G and 4G \n- Free and ad-free\n\nBased on our community-generated data we are able to help keep you better connected by giving you a practical solution to the problems of slow mobile internet. Simply follow our signal compass to walk towards better phone signal or see our in-app copoverage maps to work out which carrier is best for where you are, useful if you're thinking about switching networks. Our wifi maps help you find local public-access wireless networks (Wifi hotspots).\n\nMaps are not updated in real-time. Don’t worry though, we log the information you share with us to improve our coverage maps and performance information. We’re working hard to make sure the data you contribute to the project is available to everyone as quickly as possible. \n\nTips:\n- Not all towers and wireless hotspots are in our database - we’re working on it!\n- Moving in the direction of your cell tower (the signal compass) will not always improve reception due to interference effects/local geography\n- Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nIf you read to here (!) you should really join the OpenSignal beta to help us improve the app, just email hi@opensignal.com if you're interested.", "trackId":598298030, "trackName":"OpenSignal - Speed Test & Maps", "bundleId":"com.opensignal.OpenSignalMaps", "genreIds":["6002", "6007"], "releaseDate":"2013-04-18T13:26:15Z", "primaryGenreName":"Utilities", "primaryGenreId":6002, "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2018-07-07T12:29:04Z", "averageUserRating":3.0, "userRatingCount":33},

TRADENOW is integrated with Ally Invest, Interactive Brokers and TradeStation in the U.S. and with Questrade in Canada.\n\nEXCLUSIVE STOCK CHARTS A picture is worth a lot more than words.

Every detail has been optimized in order to save you time. By comparison, ReachFast is 1 to 3 times faster than other contacts apps in any given scenario.\n\n\nFeatures:\n* Pull-down to search, instead of tapping on a specific area. You can open the search without even looking at the screen.\n* Only One tap to call.\n* Two taps to Facetime.\n* Swipe right to message.\n* Favorites and Recently called contacts appear INLINE with the contacts... No need to switch tabs and the landing happens always on the recent, if you don't find the contact there, just pull down to search.\n* Smart search, that learns who you call the most and gives you the first result as a top hit, while reducing the number of letters you type before finding your contact.\n* Adding a contact is super fast. we don't stop you to ask if you are adding to existing or updating a new one, it happens along the way and reduces 3 steps out of the overall scenario.\n* While adding a contact, no need to move your finger and look at the upper screen to switch fields, you can swipe the keyboard to jump lines while keeping your fingers on the keyboard to save you time.\n* Forgot their names? View your contacts Chronologically. \n* Ability to show pictures, organize by first name, sounds, vibration, show emails etc.", "trackId":627585561, "trackName":"Swipe To iMessage or SMS - Tap to Call & Facetime - By ReachFast Contacts", "bundleId":"com.completure.com.contacts", "genreIds":["6007", "6002"], "releaseDate":"2013-04-22T20:42:54Z", "primaryGenreName":"Productivity", "primaryGenreId":6007, "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2014-02-19T05:34:20Z", "averageUserRating":3.5, "userRatingCount":18},

"description":"Signal GH is a tool for users of the HDHomerun networked digital TV tuner who want to monitor and improve their Over The Air (OTA) reception quality. It graphs the signal quality from multiple channels simultaneously, allowing the user to more rapidly adjust and upgrade the OTA receiving hardware for his home, i.e., cables, connections, splitters, pre-amps, and antennas.  The graph can be mirrored to a TV via Airplay and an AppleTV.\n\nUnited States users also have the benefit of a map of digital television broadcasting towers. Depends on the accuracy of your device's compass. \n\nIf you don't have an HDHomerun, you don't need this product. If you do have an HDHomerun, and use it for over the air reception, you will likely find it useful. \n\nIf the automatic scan does not find a station you expect, add the station's real channel to the list of active channels via the Channels subview of the Settings tab.\n\nSignal GH does not support QAM (digital cable) Please make sure your HDHomerun is set to use a broadcasting channel set and not a cable channel set.\n\nYou cannot use this software to watch video on your iOS device.

"description":"ChatSecure is a free and open source messaging app that features OTR encryption over XMPP. You can connect to an existing Google account, create new accounts on public XMPP servers (including via Tor), or even connect to your own server for extra security.\n\nUnlike other apps that keep you stuck in their walled garden, ChatSecure is fully interoperable with other clients that support OTR and XMPP, such as Adium, Jitsi, and more.\n\nChatSecure only uses well-known open source cryptographic libraries to keep your conversations private. Other apps may make claims about 'military grade' security but, without publicly auditable source code and verifiable end-to-end encryption, you cannot be truly safe.\n\n* XMPP with TLS certificate pinning.\n* OTR for verifiable end-to-end encryption and forward secrecy.\n* OMEMO for a mobile-friendly alternative to OTR.\n* Tor integration for easy access to XMPP .onion services.\n* SQLCipher to locally encrypt conversation logs.\n* Free and Open Source: https://github.com/chatsecure/chatsecure-ios\n\nFollow @ChatSecure on Twitter: https://twitter.com/chatsecure\n\n►► ChatSecure Donations\nSubscribe to ChatSecure to help make developing free and open source privacy tools sustainable.

"description":"ABOUT THIS COURSE\n\nThis course introduces signal processing tools currently used in geophysics. It has been elaborated both from the book \"Signal processing for geologists and geophysicists\" (J.L. Mari, F. Glangeaud, F. Coppens, 1999) and from the CD \"Signal processing in geosciences\" (F. Glangeaud ,J.L. Mari, 2000).\n\nFor signal processing specialists, it will be a source of how classical or new theories can be applied to field data.Teaching staff should find it provides a means of tackling the teaching signal processing techniques.\n\n- - -\n\nFOREWORD\n\nThis on line course presents a succession of lessons classed by theme. The different themes that are tackled are:\n\n• The Fourier Transformation\n• Common functions in spectral analysis\n• Sampling\n• Correlation\n• Wave separation\n• Seismic applications\n• The Hilbert transformation\n• Filtering\n• Near Surface Geophysics\n• Stochastic Signal Processing\n• Attributes\n\nEach theme has an introduction and a series of lessons which are associated with it. A lesson comprises of text, a video, a formulary, if judged necessary, and in some cases an applet to practice.\n\n• The text present has been voluntarily reduced; its objective is put across by the animation. This objective may be the presentation of a specific transform used in signal processing and applied in seismic processing. The term \"transform\" is used here in a very general sense. It covers at times the notion of transformation, such as the Fourier transformation or filters such as the Wiener filter. The objective perhaps being to show the application of a \"transform\" on simulated synthetic data or on real acquired geophysical data.\n\n• The video is an illustration of the text. It permits a visualization of the data, to study the influence of processing parameters on the data. The images were conceived in a manner which permits an immediate visual comparison and that enables an evaluation of the influence of a parameter change on the data processing. If an applet is associated with the video, some parameters can be modified by moving the cursors, the calculations taking place in real time.\n\n• The formulary gives the mathematical formula used in the animation. The reader is invited to use the book cited above as a reference for the notations used and the demonstrations. The formulary should be considered as a simple memory aid.\n\nThe videos and the applets have been created thanks to the MUSTIG software ( mustig.free.fr, Gérard Lejeune).\nIn this on line course, 20 lessons can be selected. For the animations based on field data measurement, the authors or organisms that provide with them are mentioned.\n\nThis on line course does not constitute a complete course in itself ; referral to the basic signal processing texts remains essential.\n\n- - -\n\nTHE AUTHOR\n\nJean-Luc Mari is at present a geophysics professor at IFP School and an IFPEN expert.

"description":"Our CoverageMap app empowers you to test network performance in areas where you live, work, and play. Not only does testing performance in your neighborhood provide you with useful insights, but the data you produce also helps carriers improve the quality of your mobile life.\n\nThe newest version of the app for iOS has expanded the functionality and ease of use found in previous versions to give you a personal network testing and comparison tool that’s better than ever. And whether you’re already familiar with our CoverageMap app or simply curious about testing mobile network performance in your neighborhood, you’ll quickly see how easy it is to get started.\n\nNew features:\n•\tImproved user interface. Our updated app not only boasts a beautiful new user interface, but it also makes it easy to find and select the options and settings you want to use before running a test. Plus, easily identify areas that have yet to be tested, and be the first to put yourself on the map. \n•\tA world of results on an expanded dashboard. Your test results can tell you a great deal about your daily mobile life. Get a broader understanding of your findings with new stats such as moving averages, histories, and more. \n•\tPersonalize your results. Wondering how performance with your carrier of choice compares between the office and at home? Now you can find out. Easily select multiple hexes on the map to compare your results, and find out if others are having the same experience. \n•\tTest how you want, when you want. Set your device to automatically run performance tests continuously, or sample network conditions in the background. Stop a test at any time with either setting. When you turn background collection on, you anonymously contribute information about your device’s data performance without using your data plan. \n•\tWe want to hear from you. While we love to see more and more data points appear on the map, you can also tell us about your experience in your own words. Whether it’s something you feel requires our attention, or you just want to say you’ve had a great experience testing performance, we want to hear from you.\n\nEnjoying the app?

"description":"SPL Meter is a professional-grade sound level meter, also known as a decibel or dB meter, for your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nModeled after a traditional analog SPL meter, we have faithfully reproduced all the characteristics and qualities found in those meters, including the ballistics, ranges, filters, and decay rates.\n\nUnder the hood we have advanced DSP-based algorithms that meet or exceed ANSI / IEC Type 1 standards. And starting with iOS 6, we can disable the mic filters and limiters, to get the real world performance of a hand-held SPL meter.\n\nAnd now, upgrade SPL Meter with iTestMic, our pro-grade test & measurement mic, made specifically for iOS devices. Using iTestMic with SPL Meter, you get a calibrated, accurate SPL Meter, that meets industry standards for Type 2 performance. See our website for more information.\n\nBut don't compare us to a Radio Shack meter, ours is much more accurate! \n\nWe have also included a digital LCD display, as shown in the image, to make this the best SPL meter available for iPhone or iPad. And this is something that the old analog meters never had! \n\nThe screen will flip when you flip the phone over, so that you can point the iPhone mic directly at the sound source. (iPhone X does not support upside down mode)\n\nSPL Meter is a universal app -- buy once, and use on all of your iOS devices.\n\nSPL Meter is built by the same team that created the other great professional audio and acoustics apps on the store, Studio Six Digital.  Built on the engine of our more expensive \"SPL\" app, SPL Meter's filters and decay rates meet or exceed ANSI type 1. This app is not a toy or a game.\n\nSPL Meter is the one audio app that everyone who works in audio must have on their phone! Not only have we made the best one, but we've priced it so you can't afford not to get it.\n\n*** FEATURES:\n\nFILTERS -- A and C weighting filters are provided.\n\nDECAY -- Choose ANSI Fast or Slow.\n\nRANGES -- 40dB to 120dB in 9 ranges.\n\nCALIBRATION -- Comes pre-calibrated for the typical iPhone or iPad built-in and headset mic, but you can adjust the calibration if you have a professional, calibrated meter to compare it to. Accesses our cloud-based iOS device calibration database, which we updates as new devices are released.\n\nINTERNAL / EXTERNAL MIC -- Select Internal to activate the included compensation filter, which is designed to flatten the frequency response of the built-in or headset mic. External will work with our iPhone Measurement Mic, to be released later this summer. See our website for more details.\n\nSPL Meter is bargain-priced to make it easy for anyone to check out one of our professional, accurate apps. Studio Six Digital is dedicated to making the iPhone and Touch a professional audio and acoustics test device.\n\nCheck out our full line of professional-grade audio and acoustics apps: SPL, the professional digital iPhone sound level meter, SPL Graph, for recording SPL over time, RTA, a 1/3 octave real-time analyzer,  FFT, for detailed acoustic analysis, ETC, the energy-time curve function, RT60, for automated octave-band decay time measurement, Speaker Pop, to test speaker polarity, and Generator, the iPhone signal generator.\n\nAlso, if you are looking for more great acoustical and audio test apps, have a look at AudioTools, our premier app for audio professionals.", "trackId":309206756, "trackName":"SPL Meter", "bundleId":"com.studiosix.SPLMeter", "genreIds":["6011", "6002"], "releaseDate":"2009-03-27T02:26:37Z", "primaryGenreName":"Music", "primaryGenreId":6011, "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2018-07-09T20:48:37Z", "averageUserRating":3.5, "userRatingCount":33},

"description":"A background running, multitasking enabled app, that alerts you to loss of cell / wifi service!\n\nNew! Now supports EMAIL of the full data logging of loss of cell service. A full color map showing pins where each location of no cell service occurred. You can now email yourself (or anyone) a complete log sorted by date (with Carrier name) of the long/lat data and time of cell service lost.\n\nNeed to know when you lose cell phone reception? Even if your phone is in your pocket or briefcase? This is the app!\n\nWorried about the reception issues you have read about? This app is always watching for loss of reception, even when you are not looking, and will alert you if it happens. A must for people who cannot afford to miss calls! Nurses, Doctors, Police, Firefighters, Moms and Dads: Never miss that important call again because you are in a dead spot with no cell service.\n\nNote: Known limitation: If you are connected to a known WiFi network, this app cannot detect the loss of 3G/4G/LTE while connected to WiFi, I am actively working on a solution to this. For a workaround, turn off WiFi if you absolutely need to know when the cellular signal drops out at all times.\n \nDon't ever miss an important call or SMS text message again, unaware that you have no cell service. Have Cell Guardian monitor for you - from the background!\n\n** New! Mute toggle for Wifi alerts and Battery Alerts per your feedback! thank you!\n\n** New! Now with AUDIBLE Low Battery Alerts. Warns you from the background with a pop up alert, plus sound, that your battery is below 50% and then below 30% and down to 5%: This is something the iPhone does not have built in, remember the older phones that would beep to warn you of low battery? now you can have that great feature back!**\n\n**No surprise bills in the mail!**\n\nLots of download apps for music and video can seamlessly go from your home Wi-Fi to a LTE network without a hiccup, thats great, but not so great if you have a capped data plan and have to pay for that LTE time! Let this app warn you when you leave Wi-Fi for LTE every-time. \n\nYou can easily test this app by turning Airplane mode on and off while the app is running, or by turning Wi-Fi on and off.

It includes Morse Code encoder and transmitter using flashlight and this can be used for learning purposes as well as in emergency or just for fun transmitting information between skilled morse code readers.\n\nIMPORTANT: In emergency please transmit international and worldwide recognized sign: SOS\n\n\n* Convenient Flashlight for iPhone and iPad on the go with big ON/OFF button switch, iPhone auto-lock is disabled so it stays on\n\n* Really fast Flashlight instant ON even before whole application starts\n\n* Encode any text to Morse code with live preview, great for learning purposes\n\n* On iPhone 4, iPad 3 and newer models equipped with flashlight you can also transmit your Morse Code using LED flashlight\n\n* Universal app that works both on iPhone and iPad (however flashlight works only on models equipped with LED flashlight) so you pay only once and use on all your devices\n\n* Compatible with iOS 4.3+ up to iOS 7\n\n* Copy encoded Morse code to clipboard for later sharing using Text messages, E-Mail or make fun of your friends and update your Facebook / Twitter status with morse code\n\n* iPhone auto-lock is disabled when in transmission or when in flashlight mode so you no need to worry about your screen auto-lock when in emergency. Transmission is limited only by your battery charge and capacity.\n\n\nSummary: Morse code encoding and sharing works on all devices, however for Flashlight and Morse Code transmission using Flashlight you will need iPhone 4 and newer.\n\n\nMorse code is a method of transmitting textual information as a series of on-off tones, lights, or clicks that can be directly understood by a skilled listener or observer without special equipment. The International Morse Code encodes the Roman alphabet, the Arabic numerals and a small set of punctuation and procedural signals as standardized sequences of short and long signals called \"dots\" and \"dashes\" respectively, or \"dits\" and \"dahs\".\n\nMore information with Morse code translation table can be found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code", "trackId":464572501, "trackName":"Flashlight+ Morse Code - Transmitter and encoder", "bundleId":"sk.mediaware.morsecode", "genreIds":["6002", "6008"], "releaseDate":"2011-09-16T01:39:01Z", "primaryGenreName":"Utilities", "primaryGenreId":6002, "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2014-04-07T21:37:32Z", "averageUserRating":3.0, "userRatingCount":5},

SatFinder 3D app will show you a 3D model of satellite dish pointed right to desired satellite. You can point your device camera to your house wall and take a look at 3D dish model direction. it is very convenient for an installation place choice and set up.\n\nAlso you can look at all available satellites for your district in real time. Just tap «AR» button of satellites list window. Point your device towards the sky and watch all available satellites for your location.\n\nThis program also is a transponders (frequencies) data base of all TV/RADIO satellites in the world. You can easily find a satellite parameters.\n\nFeatures:\n• 3D satellite dish model direction augmented reality feature (dish pointer mode)\n• View realtime satellites in the sky augmented reality feature\n• 3D LNB tilt indicator\n• Smart satellite search with sound indication\n• Sort by satellite\n• Search by channel name, radio name, provider name\n• Sort by frequency\n• Sort by Ku & C -bands\n• Displaying the channel name, radio station, a provider with the link to the official site, encoding display\n• Displaying a frequency, polarization, FEC and Symbol Rate\n• Azimuth, Elevation, LNB Skew angels for the desired satellite\n• Manual compass for devices without magnetic compass support\n• Weekly database updates\n• An enormous data base. More than 12,800 video channels, 3900 radio stations and 180 Internet service providers\n\nNotice:\nSatFinder 3D uses your phone magnetometer sensor to get your azimuth. Since the satellite position calculation depends on the accuracy of your device sensors, your device should be calibrated by shaking and moving it in a figure 8 fashion when you are in AR mode. Read your phone model instructions on how to calibrate your device compass.\n\nIf you still have problems with a device compass, tap «Manual compass On» button.

When you absolutely positively have to get out of bed at a certain time, you need the most annoying and abrasive sounds known to man (or woman).\n\nYou choose a loud, obnoxious noise, such as, Angry Cat or Chalkboard Fingernails, then set your day and time. Be sure to turn your device's sound to ON, and turn the volume all the way UP! The app even has a pop-up to remind you to do this. Then, simply put your iPhone, iPad, or iPod to sleep by pressing the button no the top.\n\nIt's that easy.\n\nYou can rest assured (literally) that you'll be on time for that final exam or business flight because Crazy Alarm Clock will send you 5 timed alerts, a minute apart. Just to warn you, there is no \"Snooze\" button! We can't guarantee that you'll get restful sleep, but you WILL get out of bed.\n\nEven if you just need a simple daily signal or a safe, timed plan to keep dinner from getting charred, Crazy Alarm Clock is the key. Here's what you get:\n\n- Simplicity – Listen to the loud sounds, choose one, and set the alarm.\n- Easy Sorting – Select your favorite sounds or arrange alphabetically.\n- Cool Design – Check out the screenshots below.\n- Obnoxious Sounds – The air horn WILL wake you up!\n- Great Extras – Upgrade to get full access to all the crazy sounds.\n\nNobody wants to be the idiot who sleeps through college graduation.

"description":"Signal Flags is an authority for identification, interpretation and use of signal flags between ships. This comprehensive app is your resource for signal flag information as specified by the International Code of Signals, the U.S. Navy, the International Sailing Federation, NATO, and Allied Forces around the world. Everything you need to know or want to know is in here.\n\n“I am a blue water sailor, cruising the East Coast of the U.S. and out to Bermuda. This app [contains] a copy of H.O. Pub 102 which is carried on the signal bridge of every commercial ship in the world. As the code meanings are uniform regardless of the nationality of the ship involved, a Portugese fisherman can use the code to request medical advice from the doctor onboard a Norwegian cruise ship even though neither speaks the other's language. Naturally, the paper copy is easier to use, but this is great in a pinch, and is a good study tool...”\n- GHK3\n\nIt's a beautiful day as you cruise the harbor in your new boat. The smell of sea water and being captain of your own vessel is pretty heady. Taking in the view, you notice a Naval ship flying unusual flags in the area you’re heading for. There’s an “A” flag, followed by a number 3 flag. You know that seafaring vessels have special signals but you don’t know what they mean. Whipping out your Signal Flags app, you quickly scroll, tapping the appropriate flags to discover that you must avoid the ship within 300 yards as they have divers in the water. You adjust your course a little to comply. Thank goodness you were able to find out before you intruded on the ship’s operation.\n\nSignal Flags have been used for communication between ships at sea since ancient times. They have evolved throughout history and now are uniformly mandated by the International Code of Signals. The flags remove the language barrier by indicating with symbols, many types of distress and information to all U.S. and Allied Forces around the globe. They are used by government, military and civilians traveling the world’s waterways.\n\nThe app contains all of the images, flags and pennants that you’ll need to know, along with detailed descriptions of their usage and meanings in international, military, and sail racing contexts. You don’t need a cumbersome book; you don’t even need an internet connection. Just pull out your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch and open Signal Flags. All the important information is contained right there in the application. Within a few seconds, you’ll know what that ship is telling you.\n\nIn addition to the signal details, this app supplies you with the complete documentation of the NIMA pub. 102 and the U.S. Department of Transportation/U.S. Coast Guard Navigation Rules (COMDTINST M16672.2D).  Both documents include extensive in-document hyperlinks for accessibility along with a specialized toolbar for quick and simple browsing.  A specialized quiz function is also provided to aid in memorization of the entire flag set. \n\n\u2028Features:\n\n* Designed and developed by a U.S. Naval Academy graduate\n* Needs no network connection once downloaded\n* Contains all current signal flag details\n* Contains complete documentation as laid out by governing sources\n* Includes a quiz function to help you memorize all the flags\n\nIf you spend time on the open water, are the employee of an organization that navigates the seas, a yacht racer, or an interested student, this application is an indispensable tool. Everything is here for you, at your fingertips, anytime, anywhere.

"description":"Generate custom color noises including brown, pink, white, blue, and violet.  Customize noise further by using low and high cut filters. Simple modern interface remembers all settings for quick generation and utilizes advanced mathematical formulas to generate all audio waves.  There are no audio files included in the application binary which keeps app size to a minimum and app performance to a maximum.\n\nWhat are benefits of listening to white noise?\n- Helps you sleep by blocking distractions\n- Pacifies fussy and crying babies\n- Relaxes and reduces stress\n- Increases focus while enhancing privacy\n- Soothes headaches and migraines\n- Masks tinnitus (ringing of the ears)\n\nWhat are the different sound colors?\n- White noise sounds similar to static of an analog TV or radio station that has stopped broadcasting.   White noise has equal energy across all sound frequencies.\n- Brown noise sounds like a powerful waterfall.  It has more energy at the lower frequencies and if you have a good speaker system with a subwoofer you should be able to really feel it.\n- Pink noise's upper sound frequencies don't fall off as fast as they do with brown noise, so you'll get a little more punch. The most interesting thing about pink noise is it's found in almost all electronic devices (known as flicker noise) and even in biological systems.\n- Blue and violet noise are the opposites of pink and brown noise, respectively, and sound like spraying water from a garden hose. It has more energy at the higher frequencies which means more treble and less bass. \n- Curious to learn more about color noises?  Check out this article for all the details:  http://www.tmsoft.com/white-noise-player/\n\nDirections:\nDrag the Sound Color slider to select brown, pink, white, blue, violet, or somewhere in-between.

"description":"A Real Time Analyzer for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. Test your speakers, tune your room, do acoustical analysis work or just have a better understanding of audio frequencies. RTA is a professional-grade acoustical analysis tool. All filters meet or exceed ANSI and IEC Class 1 specifications. \n\nIncludes Octave and 1/3 Octave modes, with selectable decay times, as well as Peak Hold and true linear Average mode.\n\n*** iOS Microphones\n\nWe have analyzied every iOS device, including all of the iPads, all iPhones, and iPod touches, and have created microphone compensation files that are applied automatically. You can trust the results you are getting, often within just a few dB of a far more expensive analyzer. Calibration is updated regularly, automatically, from our cloud-based calibration database.\n\nUpgrade to our iTestMic or iAudioInterface2 to bring your system up to full professional specs.\n\n*** Save and Recall Graphs\n\nYou can save and recall graphs, marked with the GPS location, date & time, and your comment, as well as store the image to your photo roll.\n\nExport the data as an XLS formatted file to your computer for inclusion in reports or further analysis.\n\n*** Max and Min Bars\n\nYou can also turn on resettable Max/Min bars (see image #4) to capture peaks. Double-tap to reset the bars.\n\n*** Specifications and Devices\n\nThe internal iPhone mic has a noise floor near 30 dB, and if your are running iOS 6, clips around 120 dB. \n\n*** Touch GUI\n\nFully interactive touch GUI features includes scroll up/down, pinch to zoom or compress the vertical dB scale, or swipe horizontally to get a cursor that reads out the exact dB level and frequency across the screen. To make the cursor disappear, swipe it off the graph to the left.\n\nThe landscape-mode display flips 180 degrees so that you can face the internal mic in either direction.\n\n*** Overlay Curves\n\nAlso included are optional noise curve overlays, in NCB, RC, PNC, NC, X-Curve and NR mode. See picture #2 for an example. Use this feature to get a quick reading on the noise levels in a room. Also includes the cinema large-room X-curve overlay.\n\n*** Calibration\n\nRTA can be fully calibrated, whether you are using it with the internal iOS microphone, or one of our professional test & measurement mic solutions. And, if you are using iTestMic, the mic calibration is transmitted directly to the app, so you are always calibrated.\n\n*** RTA or FFT?\n\nIf you are wondering if you should download this app or our FFT app, check out our website, we have a page devoted to this topic.\n\nSee our other acoustics and audio apps, including AudioTools.", "trackId":298839433, "trackName":"RTA", "bundleId":"com.studiosix.RTA", "genreIds":["6011", "6002"], "releaseDate":"2008-12-14T06:42:32Z", "primaryGenreName":"Music", "primaryGenreId":6011, "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2018-09-04T23:11:12Z"},

"description":"A high-quality audio Signal Generator for the iPhone. \n\nNow you can have a professional grade signal generator for your iPhone. Create sine waves, square waves, white noise, and pink noise.\n\nDon't let the well-worn look of this classic audio must-have fool you, Generator is accurate, reliable, precise, and clean.\n\n** NEW! Now supports remote control over WiFi from our AudioTools app. Connect an iOS device running Generator to your audio system, link to AudioTools on another device, and control Generator from AudioTools as you are free to move around. Requires that both devices be on the same LAN.\n\nIn sine and square wave mode, you can select between 20Hz and 20kHz using a controller that has three resolutions: octave, 1/3 octave, and fine. Frequency selection is controlled by smooth-gliding interlocking control wheels. Just spin to change frequency, by octaves, 1/3 octaves, or select fine mode to sweep through any value.\n\n*** NEW: Tap the frequency screen to pop up a keyboard so that you can enter any exact frequency.\n\n*** NEW: Tap the Wobble button to create a warble-tone signal for acoustics work. Doubles as an emergency siren!\n\nWhen you are generating pink noise and white noise, you can select full band (20Hz-20kHz), or octave band limited noise for acoustical testing.\n\nAll waveforms are laboratory accurate, and use ANSI / IEC spec filters where appropriate. \n\nThe frequency sweeps smoothly, with no glitches. The mute is soft, to prevent loud impulses when mute or turning on a lower-frequency signal.\n\nThis signal can be sent to both channels (stereo), just the right or left channel, or the right channel output phase can be inverted for pseudo-balanced mode. This mode can be used with our iPhone Balanced Cable Adapter to get a balanced signal from your iPhone. See our web site for more information.\n\nOn an iPhone 3G, we have measured distortion at .006% THD at 1000Hz at full volume (+6.5dBu balanced). See our web site for more level details.\n\nNote that digital square waves suffer from aliasing problems, and sound very strange above about 1500Hz. \n\nFuture versions will have options to select different skins.\n\nCheck out out other great professional-grade audio and acoustics apps: SPL, the iPhone professional-grade sound level meter, SPL Graph, for recording SPL over time, RTA, a 1/3 octave real time analyzer, FFT, for detailed audio analysis, ETC, the iPhone energy-time curve and decay app, RT60, for automated octave-band decay measurement, and Speaker Pop, the speaker polarity tester.\n\nEmail us within any questions, problems, or suggestions, we answer all emails promptly.", "trackId":298840802, "trackName":"Generator", "bundleId":"com.studiosix.Generator", "genreIds":["6011"], "releaseDate":"2009-01-04T03:55:33Z", "primaryGenreName":"Music", "primaryGenreId":6011, "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2018-11-04T16:28:27Z"},

"description":"IMPORTANT! THIS APPLICATION IS NOT A RADIO TUNER.  YOU CANNOT LISTEN TO THE STATIONS THROUGH THIS APP.  It just helps you find the local station frequencies so that you can quickly tune your radio to the kind of station you want.\n\nI travel all over the United States for my job, and I wanted an application that would tell me the local radio stations based on my location.  Then, I would not have to waste time searching for stations in my rental car, and waiting through commercials to see what kind of station it is.\n\nI did not find any other application that worked like I wanted, so I decided to build one myself.\n\nRadioRadar Lite will use your current location (or a city location that you set), and it will display radio stations whose towers are nearby (within the range you specify).\n\nYou can filter the results by station format so, for example, you can easily find a sports station, or a Christian stations, or a jazz station.\n\nAll the radio tower information comes from a local database, so you don't have to wait for an online search.  As a bonus, you can get a tower map showing you where the towers are, and you can select a tower and go straight to the FCC information webpage for that station.\n\n*** THE LITE VERSION IS FULLY FUNCTIONAL, BUT ONLY DISPLAYS ONE STATION PER FORMAT ***\nTo see all the local stations, check out the full version of RadioRadar in the App Store.\n\n\nFEATURES:\n* Offline database for fast and reliable searches\n* Automatically use your location or pick a city\n* Identifies national networks: NPR, KLOVE, Air1 and Fox Sports\n* Choose to filter results from several station formats\n* Choose maximum distance to search for radio towers\n* See relative signal strengths to easily choose the best stations\n* Get a map view with tower locations annotated\n* Get detailed station and tower information with a focused map view\n* Tap on a tower annotation and you can choose to be taken directly to the FCC detailed information page for the selected station\n\nNOTE:\nThe station signal strength bars are only an approximation, based on the  station's broadcast power and your distance to the tower.

"description":"NOTE: Use of eSignal Mobile requires a subscription to eSignal or LiveCharts, real-time streaming quotes and analysis products for the active trader.\n\neSignal Mobile provides instant access to the exchanges and services you receive on your desktop with no additional exchange fees.  By adding the eSignal Mobile service to your eSignal account you’ll also get access to QuoTrek Mobile. It is the ideal companion service to the eSignal terminal product.\n\nIts home screen provides one-view access to quotes, charts, and news, plus separate windows for Watch Lists, Detailed Quotes, News, Charts, Stock or Futures Option, Hot Lists and Company Profiles. \n\nThese app features help make for a seamless desktop to mobile experience:\n\nWatch List – Real-time or delayed quotes from the world’s exchanges. \n\nDetailed Quotes – Quote grid with instrument type-specific configurations and the ability to customize the grid with hundreds of data points. \n\nCharts – Robust streaming interactive charts with overlays, comparison studies, and a wide variety of chart aggregations and timeframes. \n\nNews – Streaming real-time news from respected sources such as Dow Jones. \n\nFundamentals – Comprehensive tearsheet profiles for stock, ETF and mutual fund securities provide fundamental and reference data for investment evaluation.\n\nOptions – Equity and futures option chains with filters for strike date, in-the-money, near-the-money and out-of-the-money views. \n\nHot Lists – wide range of preset market mover views covering most active, gainers/losers, volume and more.\n\nPreferences – Wide range of customizable options for each window type. \n\nConflation Settings – Streaming data usage can be controlled through custom data conflation settings, which allows users to control data usage (and associated cellular data costs).  Data conflation (in seconds) can be set independently for Wifi and cellular network connections. \n\nSynchronized Entitlements – All the same entitlements that govern a user’s eSignal or LiveCharts desktop account, including rights to access streaming exchange data and news content, are respected in eSignal Mobile. The same account is used to log on to desktop and mobile, ensuring a user is only logged in to on one device at any given time.

"description":"***** \"As a former IEEE Technical Committee Chair for Signal Processing, I find this app amazingly flexible and useful. Works very well with its proper designed-in control selections.\" - Roblake \n\nSpectrum Analyzer for iOS is a powerful real-time audio analysis app. Designed with musicians and recording engineers in mind, it can also be used by anyone interested in the world of sound. Ideal for room tuning or speaker tuning, the app enables portable, precision audio measurement and visualization. \n\nFeature Highlights: \n● Octave Band Real Time Analyzer \n● FFT Plot (Fast Fourier Transform) \n● Spectrograph module \n● Test Tone and White/Pink Noise Generator \n● Native iPhone X graphics\n\n>>> Check out the demo videos at SpectrumAnalyzerApp.com \n\nAudio input may be acquired via the built-in microphone or an external measurement microphone.
