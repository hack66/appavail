"description":"OpenSignal is the ultimate signal toolkit that shows you how to get a better network connection instantly, find nearby free Wifi hotspots worldwide, view signal maps so that you can compare performance of networks in your area and test the speed of your mobile or Wifi connection. \n\nUnlike other apps, which look for maximum possible speed through optimized testing, OpenSignal informs you about your true speed - what you are likely to experience when normally using your phone. Anyone using the app contributes data, informing others about real-world, not estimated, mobile performance (and we'll never ask you for personal information, just your signal strength stats).\n\nWith OpenSignal you can map cellular coverage, find Wi-Fi hotspots, test and improve your reception & get faster data.\n\n- Signal compass points you in the direction your signal is coming from \n- Speed test for download, upload and latency\n- Map of cell towers and Wifi hotspots\n- Coverage maps allow you see the best/worst places for 2G, 3G and 4G \n- Free and ad-free\n\nBased on our community-generated data we are able to help keep you better connected by giving you a practical solution to the problems of slow mobile internet. Simply follow our signal compass to walk towards better phone signal or see our in-app copoverage maps to work out which carrier is best for where you are, useful if you're thinking about switching networks. Our wifi maps help you find local public-access wireless networks (Wifi hotspots).\n\nMaps are not updated in real-time. Don’t worry though, we log the information you share with us to improve our coverage maps and performance information. We’re working hard to make sure the data you contribute to the project is available to everyone as quickly as possible. \n\nTips:\n- Not all towers and wireless hotspots are in our database - we’re working on it!\n- Moving in the direction of your cell tower (the signal compass) will not always improve reception due to interference effects/local geography\n- Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nIf you read to here (!) you should really join the OpenSignal beta to help us improve the app, just email hi@opensignal.com if you're interested.", "bundleId":"com.opensignal.OpenSignalMaps", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2018-07-07T12:29:04Z", "genreIds":["6002", "6007"], "releaseDate":"2013-04-18T13:26:15Z", "primaryGenreName":"Utilities", "primaryGenreId":6002, "averageUserRating":3.5, "userRatingCount":31},

"description":"Take the guess work out of aligning any TV antenna. Within seconds Antenna Mate will accurately* point to the direction of your best** TV reception from anywhere in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Antenna Mate is used by professional installers, caravaners, and DIYers from city and country areas.\n\nWE HAVE GOT YOU COVERED IN AUSTRALIA\n\n* 601 broadcasting sites.\n* 2,857 digital transmitters.\n* All cities and towns in QLD, NSW, ACT, VIC, TAS, SA, WA and NT where digital terrestrial television is available***\n\nWE HAVE GOT YOU COVERED IN NEW ZEALAND\n\n* 35 broadcasting sites.\n* 344 transmitters\n* All cities and towns in the North and South Islands where digital terrestrial television is available****\n\nWE HAVE GOT YOU COVERED IN THE UNITED KINGDOM\n\n* 1,151 broadcasting sites.\n* 3,698 digital transmitters.\n* All cities and towns in England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands where digital terrestrial television is available*****\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nUsing your current location, your device's compass, and the target site's effective radiated power, Antenna Mate instantly estimates the signal strength of all nearby sites and automatically plots a bearing to the best one**.\n\nUnder normal circumstances you should get an initial result within seconds. The longer you leave Antenna Mate open, the more accurate it will become. For best results use Antenna Mate outside in an open space and away from objects which cause interference.\n\nAntenna Mate doesn't need an internet connection, that's one of the reasons why it's so fast.\n\nDETAILED TRANSMITTER INFO\n\nComplete listings of all digital terrestrial transmitters are available at each site. Listings include the callsign, frequency (MHz), channel, polarisation, and effective radiated power (kW).\n\nALL SITES BY STRENGTH OR DISTANCE\n\nPrefer to align your TV antenna with another broadcasting site? No worries! Sites can be listed from strongest to weakest, or closest to furthest away. Pick any site from the list and Antenna Mate instantly plots a new bearing to the targeted site.\n\nUsing an amplifier or high gain antenna? You can increase the search radius up to 200 km (120 mi) from your current location.\n\nLIGHT AND DARK DISPLAY SWITCHING\n\nWhen your device is in direct sunlight Antenna Mate will automatically switch to a light display making the arrow easy to see. Perfect for performing an alignment during the middle of the day.\n\nUSE IT UPSIDE DOWN, OR THE RIGHT WAY UP\n\nAntenna Mate is smart enough to know when your device is being held upside down, or the right way up. Either way, it will always point to the targeted site.\n\nSUPPORT AND FEEDBACK\n\nWe would love to hear your feedback or help you troubleshoot. Send an e-mail to support@antennamate.com or tweet @antennamate.

More control.\n• Unlimited attachments\n• Retract (\"un-send\") an unread message\n• Nicknames\n• Themes\n• Priority customer support\n\nConfide has been used in over 180 countries and has been featured in Fortune, Forbes, Bloomberg, NYT, WSJ, Washington Post and more.\n\nConfide allows you to communicate digitally with the same level of privacy and security as the spoken word.\n\nGet Confide and retake control of your digital conversations.\n\n———\n\nScreenShield is a new technology that is only supported when the message recipient is using a recent version of Confide. But don’t worry, older versions of Confide are still screenshot-protected by our reading experience.\n\n———\n\nConfide for iMessage allows you to send and receive Confide messages entirely within iMessage. It’s completely frictionless – there’s no need to create an account. Due to technical limitations of iMessage, Confide for iMessage does not offer the same level of screenshot protection as the main version of Confide.\n\n———\n\nPrice may vary by location. Subscriptions will be charged to your credit card through your iTunes account.

"description":"SPL Meter is a professional-grade sound level meter, also known as a decibel or dB meter, for your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nModeled after a traditional analog SPL meter, we have faithfully reproduced all the characteristics and qualities found in those meters, including the ballistics, ranges, filters, and decay rates.\n\nUnder the hood we have advanced DSP-based algorithms that meet or exceed ANSI / IEC Type 1 standards. And starting with iOS 6, we can disable the mic filters and limiters, to get the real world performance of a hand-held SPL meter.\n\nAnd now, upgrade SPL Meter with iTestMic, our pro-grade test & measurement mic, made specifically for iOS devices. Using iTestMic with SPL Meter, you get a calibrated, accurate SPL Meter, that meets industry standards for Type 2 performance. See our website for more information.\n\nBut don't compare us to a Radio Shack meter, ours is much more accurate! \n\nWe have also included a digital LCD display, as shown in the image, to make this the best SPL meter available for iPhone or iPad. And this is something that the old analog meters never had! \n\nThe screen will flip when you flip the phone over, so that you can point the iPhone mic directly at the sound source. (iPhone X does not support upside down mode)\n\nSPL Meter is a universal app -- buy once, and use on all of your iOS devices.\n\nSPL Meter is built by the same team that created the other great professional audio and acoustics apps on the store, Studio Six Digital.  Built on the engine of our more expensive \"SPL\" app, SPL Meter's filters and decay rates meet or exceed ANSI type 1. This app is not a toy or a game.\n\nSPL Meter is the one audio app that everyone who works in audio must have on their phone!

Accesses our cloud-based iOS device calibration database, which we updates as new devices are released.\n\nINTERNAL / EXTERNAL MIC -- Select Internal to activate the included compensation filter, which is designed to flatten the frequency response of the built-in or headset mic. External will work with our iPhone Measurement Mic, to be released later this summer. See our website for more details.\n\nSPL Meter is bargain-priced to make it easy for anyone to check out one of our professional, accurate apps.

"description":"ABOUT THIS COURSE\n\nThis course introduces signal processing tools currently used in geophysics. It has been elaborated both from the book \"Signal processing for geologists and geophysicists\" (J.L. Mari, F. Glangeaud, F. Coppens, 1999) and from the CD \"Signal processing in geosciences\" (F. Glangeaud ,J.L. Mari, 2000).\n\nFor signal processing specialists, it will be a source of how classical or new theories can be applied to field data.Teaching staff should find it provides a means of tackling the teaching signal processing techniques.\n\n- - -\n\nFOREWORD\n\nThis on line course presents a succession of lessons classed by theme. The different themes that are tackled are:\n\n• The Fourier Transformation\n• Common functions in spectral analysis\n• Sampling\n• Correlation\n• Wave separation\n• Seismic applications\n• The Hilbert transformation\n• Filtering\n• Near Surface Geophysics\n• Stochastic Signal Processing\n• Attributes\n\nEach theme has an introduction and a series of lessons which are associated with it. A lesson comprises of text, a video, a formulary, if judged necessary, and in some cases an applet to practice.\n\n• The text present has been voluntarily reduced; its objective is put across by the animation. This objective may be the presentation of a specific transform used in signal processing and applied in seismic processing. The term \"transform\" is used here in a very general sense. It covers at times the notion of transformation, such as the Fourier transformation or filters such as the Wiener filter. The objective perhaps being to show the application of a \"transform\" on simulated synthetic data or on real acquired geophysical data.\n\n• The video is an illustration of the text. It permits a visualization of the data, to study the influence of processing parameters on the data. The images were conceived in a manner which permits an immediate visual comparison and that enables an evaluation of the influence of a parameter change on the data processing. If an applet is associated with the video, some parameters can be modified by moving the cursors, the calculations taking place in real time.\n\n• The formulary gives the mathematical formula used in the animation. The reader is invited to use the book cited above as a reference for the notations used and the demonstrations. The formulary should be considered as a simple memory aid.\n\nThe videos and the applets have been created thanks to the MUSTIG software ( mustig.free.fr, Gérard Lejeune).\nIn this on line course, 20 lessons can be selected. For the animations based on field data measurement, the authors or organisms that provide with them are mentioned.\n\nThis on line course does not constitute a complete course in itself ; referral to the basic signal processing texts remains essential.\n\n- - -\n\nTHE AUTHOR\n\nJean-Luc Mari is at present a geophysics professor at IFP School and an IFPEN expert. He supervises the MSc research program in \"Lithosphere, Basins, Petroleum\" part of the Master's program in Science and Technology (Paris VI).\n\nJean-Luc Mari is a member of the European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers.\n\nJean-Luc Mari is author and co-author of patents (in the field of acoustic well logging), numerous scientific articles and books on geophysical methods and signal processing.\n\nHe has been involved in the design and development of specific teaching aids (on-line (http://www-ig.unil.ch/cours/) and CD-ROMs).\n\nHis main fields of expertise are seismic acquisition and processing, geophysics of reservoirs and civil engineering.", "bundleId":"com.odysys.signalprocessing", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2016-09-19T01:14:06Z", "genreIds":["6017", "6018"], "releaseDate":"2012-03-19T21:17:07Z", "primaryGenreName":"Education", "primaryGenreId":6017},

"description":"A background running, multitasking enabled app, that alerts you to loss of cell / wifi service!\n\nNew! Now supports EMAIL of the full data logging of loss of cell service. A full color map showing pins where each location of no cell service occurred. You can now email yourself (or anyone) a complete log sorted by date (with Carrier name) of the long/lat data and time of cell service lost.\n\nNeed to know when you lose cell phone reception? Even if your phone is in your pocket or briefcase? This is the app!\n\nWorried about the reception issues you have read about? This app is always watching for loss of reception, even when you are not looking, and will alert you if it happens. A must for people who cannot afford to miss calls! Nurses, Doctors, Police, Firefighters, Moms and Dads: Never miss that important call again because you are in a dead spot with no cell service.\n\nNote: Known limitation: If you are connected to a known WiFi network, this app cannot detect the loss of 3G/4G/LTE while connected to WiFi, I am actively working on a solution to this. For a workaround, turn off WiFi if you absolutely need to know when the cellular signal drops out at all times.\n \nDon't ever miss an important call or SMS text message again, unaware that you have no cell service. Have Cell Guardian monitor for you - from the background!\n\n** New! Mute toggle for Wifi alerts and Battery Alerts per your feedback! thank you!\n\n** New! Now with AUDIBLE Low Battery Alerts. Warns you from the background with a pop up alert, plus sound, that your battery is below 50% and then below 30% and down to 5%: This is something the iPhone does not have built in, remember the older phones that would beep to warn you of low battery? now you can have that great feature back!**\n\n**No surprise bills in the mail!**\n\nLots of download apps for music and video can seamlessly go from your home Wi-Fi to a LTE network without a hiccup, thats great, but not so great if you have a capped data plan and have to pay for that LTE time! Let this app warn you when you leave Wi-Fi for LTE every-time. \n\nYou can easily test this app by turning Airplane mode on and off while the app is running, or by turning Wi-Fi on and off. You will see the pop up alerts.\n\nAnother fun way to test this: If you use Wi-Fi at home, walk around your block and see how far you can get before the app beeps to tell you you lost your Wi-Fi connection.\n\nIf you are not on iOS 4 or later yet, you can still use our \"No Signal\" app which runs on all versions of the OS (but does not run in background mode).\n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.", "bundleId":"com.janus.", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2015-07-10T23:43:56Z", "genreIds":["6002", "6000"], "releaseDate":"2010-06-24T16:27:09Z", "primaryGenreName":"Utilities", "primaryGenreId":6002},

"description":"Signal Flags is an authority for identification, interpretation and use of signal flags between ships. This comprehensive app is your resource for signal flag information as specified by the International Code of Signals, the U.S. Navy, the International Sailing Federation, NATO, and Allied Forces around the world. Everything you need to know or want to know is in here.\n\n“I am a blue water sailor, cruising the East Coast of the U.S. and out to Bermuda. This app [contains] a copy of H.O. Pub 102 which is carried on the signal bridge of every commercial ship in the world. As the code meanings are uniform regardless of the nationality of the ship involved, a Portugese fisherman can use the code to request medical advice from the doctor onboard a Norwegian cruise ship even though neither speaks the other's language. Naturally, the paper copy is easier to use, but this is great in a pinch, and is a good study tool...”\n- GHK3\n\nIt's a beautiful day as you cruise the harbor in your new boat. The smell of sea water and being captain of your own vessel is pretty heady. Taking in the view, you notice a Naval ship flying unusual flags in the area you’re heading for. There’s an “A” flag, followed by a number 3 flag. You know that seafaring vessels have special signals but you don’t know what they mean. Whipping out your Signal Flags app, you quickly scroll, tapping the appropriate flags to discover that you must avoid the ship within 300 yards as they have divers in the water. You adjust your course a little to comply. Thank goodness you were able to find out before you intruded on the ship’s operation.\n\nSignal Flags have been used for communication between ships at sea since ancient times. They have evolved throughout history and now are uniformly mandated by the International Code of Signals. The flags remove the language barrier by indicating with symbols, many types of distress and information to all U.S. and Allied Forces around the globe. They are used by government, military and civilians traveling the world’s waterways.\n\nThe app contains all of the images, flags and pennants that you’ll need to know, along with detailed descriptions of their usage and meanings in international, military, and sail racing contexts. You don’t need a cumbersome book; you don’t even need an internet connection. Just pull out your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch and open Signal Flags. All the important information is contained right there in the application. Within a few seconds, you’ll know what that ship is telling you.\n\nIn addition to the signal details, this app supplies you with the complete documentation of the NIMA pub. 102 and the U.S. Department of Transportation/U.S. Coast Guard Navigation Rules (COMDTINST M16672.2D).  Both documents include extensive in-document hyperlinks for accessibility along with a specialized toolbar for quick and simple browsing.  A specialized quiz function is also provided to aid in memorization of the entire flag set. \n\n\u2028Features:\n\n* Designed and developed by a U.S. Naval Academy graduate\n* Needs no network connection once downloaded\n* Contains all current signal flag details\n* Contains complete documentation as laid out by governing sources\n* Includes a quiz function to help you memorize all the flags\n\nIf you spend time on the open water, are the employee of an organization that navigates the seas, a yacht racer, or an interested student, this application is an indispensable tool. Everything is here for you, at your fingertips, anytime, anywhere.

By comparison, ReachFast is 1 to 3 times faster than other contacts apps in any given scenario.\n\n\nFeatures:\n* Pull-down to search, instead of tapping on a specific area. You can open the search without even looking at the screen.\n* Only One tap to call.\n* Two taps to Facetime.\n* Swipe right to message.\n* Favorites and Recently called contacts appear INLINE with the contacts... No need to switch tabs and the landing happens always on the recent, if you don't find the contact there, just pull down to search.\n* Smart search, that learns who you call the most and gives you the first result as a top hit, while reducing the number of letters you type before finding your contact.\n* Adding a contact is super fast. we don't stop you to ask if you are adding to existing or updating a new one, it happens along the way and reduces 3 steps out of the overall scenario.\n* While adding a contact, no need to move your finger and look at the upper screen to switch fields, you can swipe the keyboard to jump lines while keeping your fingers on the keyboard to save you time.\n* Forgot their names? View your contacts Chronologically. \n* Ability to show pictures, organize by first name, sounds, vibration, show emails etc.", "bundleId":"com.completure.com.contacts", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2014-02-19T05:34:20Z", "genreIds":["6007", "6002"], "releaseDate":"2013-04-22T20:42:54Z", "primaryGenreName":"Productivity", "primaryGenreId":6007},

"description":"Generate custom color noises including brown, pink, white, blue, and violet.  Customize noise further by using low and high cut filters. Simple modern interface remembers all settings for quick generation and utilizes advanced mathematical formulas to generate all audio waves.  There are no audio files included in the application binary which keeps app size to a minimum and app performance to a maximum.\n\nWhat are benefits of listening to white noise?\n- Helps you sleep by blocking distractions\n- Pacifies fussy and crying babies\n- Relaxes and reduces stress\n- Increases focus while enhancing privacy\n- Soothes headaches and migraines\n- Masks tinnitus (ringing of the ears)\n\nWhat are the different sound colors?\n- White noise sounds similar to static of an analog TV or radio station that has stopped broadcasting.   White noise has equal energy across all sound frequencies.\n- Brown noise sounds like a powerful waterfall.  It has more energy at the lower frequencies and if you have a good speaker system with a subwoofer you should be able to really feel it.\n- Pink noise's upper sound frequencies don't fall off as fast as they do with brown noise, so you'll get a little more punch. The most interesting thing about pink noise is it's found in almost all electronic devices (known as flicker noise) and even in biological systems.\n- Blue and violet noise are the opposites of pink and brown noise, respectively, and sound like spraying water from a garden hose. It has more energy at the higher frequencies which means more treble and less bass. \n- Curious to learn more about color noises?  Check out this article for all the details:  http://www.tmsoft.com/white-noise-player/\n\nDirections:\nDrag the Sound Color slider to select brown, pink, white, blue, violet, or somewhere in-between.  Next, drag the low and high cut filters to further customize to your liking.  Adjust device volume using the on-screen volume slider to a comfortable level.  You can also specify to play audio to any AirPlay supported device.  Toggle audio playback using the Play/Pause button.\n\nCreated by the audio experts at TMSOFT that brought you the famous White Noise app.  Check out all our apps and sounds at http://www.tmsoft.com/", "bundleId":"com.tmsoft.NoiseGenerator", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2018-06-07T00:33:09Z", "genreIds":["6002", "6020"], "releaseDate":"2017-03-03T16:45:31Z", "primaryGenreName":"Utilities", "primaryGenreId":6002, "averageUserRating":5.0, "userRatingCount":12},

"description":"A Real Time Analyzer for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. Test your speakers, tune your room, do acoustical analysis work or just have a better understanding of audio frequencies. RTA is a professional-grade acoustical analysis tool. All filters meet or exceed ANSI and IEC Class 1 specifications. \n\nIncludes Octave and 1/3 Octave modes, with selectable decay times, as well as Peak Hold and true linear Average mode.\n\n*** iOS Microphones\n\nWe have analyzied every iOS device, including all of the iPads, all iPhones, and iPod touches, and have created microphone compensation files that are applied automatically. You can trust the results you are getting, often within just a few dB of a far more expensive analyzer. Calibration is updated regularly, automatically, from our cloud-based calibration database.\n\nUpgrade to our iTestMic or iAudioInterface2 to bring your system up to full professional specs.\n\n*** Save and Recall Graphs\n\nYou can save and recall graphs, marked with the GPS location, date & time, and your comment, as well as store the image to your photo roll.\n\nExport the data as an XLS formatted file to your computer for inclusion in reports or further analysis.\n\n*** Max and Min Bars\n\nYou can also turn on resettable Max/Min bars (see image #4) to capture peaks. Double-tap to reset the bars.\n\n*** Specifications and Devices\n\nThe internal iPhone mic has a noise floor near 30 dB, and if your are running iOS 6, clips around 120 dB. \n\n*** Touch GUI\n\nFully interactive touch GUI features includes scroll up/down, pinch to zoom or compress the vertical dB scale, or swipe horizontally to get a cursor that reads out the exact dB level and frequency across the screen. To make the cursor disappear, swipe it off the graph to the left.\n\nThe landscape-mode display flips 180 degrees so that you can face the internal mic in either direction.\n\n*** Overlay Curves\n\nAlso included are optional noise curve overlays, in NCB, RC, PNC, NC, X-Curve and NR mode. See picture #2 for an example. Use this feature to get a quick reading on the noise levels in a room. Also includes the cinema large-room X-curve overlay.\n\n*** Calibration\n\nRTA can be fully calibrated, whether you are using it with the internal iOS microphone, or one of our professional test & measurement mic solutions. And, if you are using iTestMic, the mic calibration is transmitted directly to the app, so you are always calibrated.\n\n*** RTA or FFT?\n\nIf you are wondering if you should download this app or our FFT app, check out our website, we have a page devoted to this topic.\n\nSee our other acoustics and audio apps, including AudioTools.", "bundleId":"com.studiosix.RTA", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2018-09-04T23:11:12Z", "genreIds":["6011", "6002"], "releaseDate":"2008-12-14T06:42:32Z", "primaryGenreName":"Music", "primaryGenreId":6011, "averageUserRating":4.5, "userRatingCount":18},

"description":"Everybody knows that catching the start is essential in sailing. Finally there is a great Sailing Watch available for the iPhone and it works great with the Apple Watch.\n\nThis app provides a timer with unique features and unparalleled ease of use for sail racing. When you hear or see a race signal just press Gun! - You can adjust if it is a 5, 4 or 1 minute warning afterwards!  And if it was just a loud noise from a flapping sail and not a race signal you can easily jump back to the previous timer.\n\nIt defaults to the standard ISAF 5,4,1,0 sequence but it can handle arbitrary countdown from 30 minutes down to 0\n\nNow you can focus on other things like wind (directly in the app - simply configure your own favourite weather on the config page) and other boats potentially giving you yet another edge!\n\n** Please read more on the info \"i\" page in the app **\n\nYou can enable GPS and get Speed over Ground (SOG) and Course over Ground (COG) presented next to the timer to help you keep track of wind and speed in the seconds before and after start. The Wind page shows a graph of COG and SOG which can help you track wind shifts.\n\nThe app also provides convenient direct access to your configurable weather page.\n\nIt is designed to work on iPhone with or without Apple Watch and a lot of people seem to be using it with iPads as well.\n\nTIP: On the Watch it is recommended that you (at least temporarily) activate Resume to Last Used App so that you just have to raise your wrist to get the time left:\nSettings->General->Activate on Wrist Raise->Resume to: Last Used App\n\nThe iPhone application also contains a convenient reference to starting signals and customisable local weather information.\n\nHealthKit integration:\nThe app provides limited HealthKit integration and can optionally start a Sailing Workout activity during race start.\n\nSummary of Features:\n* Simply the best countdown timer ever if you ask us :)\n* Most of the feature work on Watch and  iPhone. Watch Series 2 needed for GPS without iPhone nearby.\n* Current Course and Speed Over Ground based on GPS\n* GPS based distance to line (still being tuned but works - within limits of GPS accuracy)\n* Speed up / Slow down estimate for time to get to line\n* History plot of Course and Speed Over Ground that allow you to track wind shifts\n* Prevalent headings - advanced formula lists common headings to help identify windshifts\n* Man Over Board function - it shows time, distance and compass bearing to the location the button was pressed (NOTE: intended as a secondary non life critical aid only) \n* Embedded browser for convenient access to your favourite weather (configurable)\n* ISAF Race Signals reference - to help settle what that strange flag shown on the race committee means before the race starts...\n* Choice of Magnetic or True course indication\n* Lock function to prevent unwanted changes\n\n\nNOTE: If you have iPhone sound problems when app is started in background check your mute button and volume, bring the iPhone app to the foreground, you can also test sound on the settings page.\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: If you enable the GPS feature the app runs in the background for a limited time before it disables GPS.\n\n\"Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\"", "bundleId":"Olcom-Invest.Race-Master", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2019-03-08T11:36:05Z", "genreIds":["6004", "6002"], "releaseDate":"2015-07-02T21:10:25Z", "primaryGenreName":"Sports", "primaryGenreId":6004},

"description":"Audio Kit is a collection of four tools which are essential for those working in audio, sound and music. A real time Spectrum Analyser, a Scope to display waveforms, an SPL (Sound Pressure Level) Meter, and a Signal Generator producing sine waves, white noise and pink noise. Sweep generation with In App Purchase.\n\u2028\n-View a real time spectrum of audio with the Spectrum Analyser and identify peak frequencies precisely\n\n\u2028-View the actual waveform of the audio signal with the Scope \n\n\u2028-An SPL Meter provides measurement of sound levels using an A-weighting\n\n\u2028-The Signal Generator provides a sine wave output up to 20,000Hz in 1 Hz steps, along with noise generators for white and pink noise. Sweep generation with In App Purchase\n\n** Spectrum\u2028 **\n\nFFT (Fast Fourier Transform) is used to calculate the frequencies in the Spectrum Analyser and these are displayed in real time. The frequency is displayed in either logarithmic or linear scale.\n\nThree FFT sizes of 8192, 4096 and 2048 are selectable, giving fine resolution of frequencies. Interpolation gives resolution to within 1Hz.\n\n\u20286 different FFT window function types can be selected - Hamming, Hann, Rectangular, Bartlett, Triangular and Blackman. \u2028 \n\nNumber of FFT windows can be selected from 1 through 4.\n\nThe strongest frequency is displayed both above the peak, and optionally, in a large number display in the center of the screen. The large number display can be quickly switched on or off by double tapping the screen.\u2028\n\nThere is a screen capture facility in the Spectrum Analyser allowing you to save the spectra  for future reference along with details of the FFT parameters, time and date.\u2028 \n\nA single tap freezes the screen. Other features such as screen capture and double tap to toggle large number display still work during the freeze. This feature can be turned off in preferences if it’s not desired.\u2028\n\n** Scope ** \n\nThe display of the Scope can be adjusted easily using pinch gestures in both horizontal and vertical directions. Zero crossing detection of the waveform provides a smooth display and can be set to either positive or negative direction zero crossing.\n\n\u2028\u2028There is a screen capture facility in the Scope allowing you to save waveforms for future reference.\u2028\n\n** SPL Meter ** \n\n\u2028The SPL Meter continuously displays the sound pressure level using an A-weighting, and has resettable minimum and maximum displays also. \n\nSPL Meter can be calibrated against a reference standard or meter.\n\nSPL Meter has a continuous ticker style trace of the SPL over time.\u2028\n\n** Signal Generator ** \n\u2028 \nThe Signal Generator has 3 different output types: \n\n- Sine wave \n- White noise \n- Pink noise \n\n\u2028The output of the Signal Generator can be viewed on the other parts of the App.\u2028 \n\nThe sine wave frequency selected using picker wheels allows for accurate control of frequency to within 1Hz. Volume for the sine wave and noise signals is continuously adjustable.\u2028\u2028\n\nWith an In App Purpose one can add a sine wave sweep generator functionality to the Signal Generator. The sweep generator can sweep increasing and decreasing frequencies, and using either a linear or log sweep rate.\n\n**Settings\u2028 **\n\nAll of the user preferences in each of the above applications can be made persistent between restarts of the App. \n\nAll parts of the App have direct access to a help document. \n\nAudio Kit - essential for those working in audio, sound and music.", "bundleId":"com.sinusoid.audiokit", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2018-11-05T00:49:17Z", "genreIds":["6011", "6002"], "releaseDate":"2010-06-18T07:00:00Z", "primaryGenreName":"Music", "primaryGenreId":6011},

"description":"IMPORTANT! THIS APPLICATION IS NOT A RADIO TUNER.  YOU CANNOT LISTEN TO THE STATIONS THROUGH THIS APP.  It just helps you find the local station frequencies so that you can quickly tune your radio to the kind of station you want.\n\nI travel all over the United States for my job, and I wanted an application that would tell me the local radio stations based on my location.  Then, I would not have to waste time searching for stations in my rental car, and waiting through commercials to see what kind of station it is.\n\nI did not find any other application that worked like I wanted, so I decided to build one myself.\n\nRadioRadar Lite will use your current location (or a city location that you set), and it will display radio stations whose towers are nearby (within the range you specify).\n\nYou can filter the results by station format so, for example, you can easily find a sports station, or a Christian stations, or a jazz station.\n\nAll the radio tower information comes from a local database, so you don't have to wait for an online search.  As a bonus, you can get a tower map showing you where the towers are, and you can select a tower and go straight to the FCC information webpage for that station.\n\n*** THE LITE VERSION IS FULLY FUNCTIONAL, BUT ONLY DISPLAYS ONE STATION PER FORMAT ***\nTo see all the local stations, check out the full version of RadioRadar in the App Store.\n\n\nFEATURES:\n* Offline database for fast and reliable searches\n* Automatically use your location or pick a city\n* Identifies national networks: NPR, KLOVE, Air1 and Fox Sports\n* Choose to filter results from several station formats\n* Choose maximum distance to search for radio towers\n* See relative signal strengths to easily choose the best stations\n* Get a map view with tower locations annotated\n* Get detailed station and tower information with a focused map view\n* Tap on a tower annotation and you can choose to be taken directly to the FCC detailed information page for the selected station\n\nNOTE:\nThe station signal strength bars are only an approximation, based on the  station's broadcast power and your distance to the tower.

"description":"A high-quality audio Signal Generator for the iPhone. \n\nNow you can have a professional grade signal generator for your iPhone. Create sine waves, square waves, white noise, and pink noise.\n\nDon't let the well-worn look of this classic audio must-have fool you, Generator is accurate, reliable, precise, and clean.\n\n** NEW! Now supports remote control over WiFi from our AudioTools app. Connect an iOS device running Generator to your audio system, link to AudioTools on another device, and control Generator from AudioTools as you are free to move around. Requires that both devices be on the same LAN.\n\nIn sine and square wave mode, you can select between 20Hz and 20kHz using a controller that has three resolutions: octave, 1/3 octave, and fine. Frequency selection is controlled by smooth-gliding interlocking control wheels. Just spin to change frequency, by octaves, 1/3 octaves, or select fine mode to sweep through any value.\n\n*** NEW: Tap the frequency screen to pop up a keyboard so that you can enter any exact frequency.\n\n*** NEW: Tap the Wobble button to create a warble-tone signal for acoustics work. Doubles as an emergency siren!\n\nWhen you are generating pink noise and white noise, you can select full band (20Hz-20kHz), or octave band limited noise for acoustical testing.\n\nAll waveforms are laboratory accurate, and use ANSI / IEC spec filters where appropriate. \n\nThe frequency sweeps smoothly, with no glitches. The mute is soft, to prevent loud impulses when mute or turning on a lower-frequency signal.\n\nThis signal can be sent to both channels (stereo), just the right or left channel, or the right channel output phase can be inverted for pseudo-balanced mode. This mode can be used with our iPhone Balanced Cable Adapter to get a balanced signal from your iPhone. See our web site for more information.\n\nOn an iPhone 3G, we have measured distortion at .006% THD at 1000Hz at full volume (+6.5dBu balanced). See our web site for more level details.\n\nNote that digital square waves suffer from aliasing problems, and sound very strange above about 1500Hz. \n\nFuture versions will have options to select different skins.\n\nCheck out out other great professional-grade audio and acoustics apps: SPL, the iPhone professional-grade sound level meter, SPL Graph, for recording SPL over time, RTA, a 1/3 octave real time analyzer, FFT, for detailed audio analysis, ETC, the iPhone energy-time curve and decay app, RT60, for automated octave-band decay measurement, and Speaker Pop, the speaker polarity tester.\n\nEmail us within any questions, problems, or suggestions, we answer all emails promptly.", "bundleId":"com.studiosix.Generator", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2018-11-04T16:28:27Z", "genreIds":["6011"], "releaseDate":"2009-01-04T03:55:33Z", "primaryGenreName":"Music", "primaryGenreId":6011},

"description":"Drakdoo is a Forex & Cryptocurrency trading app that offers touch friendly charts and intelligent alerts, allowing you to stay on top of all cryptocurrencies as well as traditional markets without being glued to the screen 24/7.\n\n- Perform in-depth analysis, annotate charts, using an interface tailored for mobile.\n\n- Continuous Notifications: Next to one-time alerts that fire when a price breach occurs, we also offer continuous alerts that fire each time the price moves by a configurable threshold.\n\n- Intelligent Alerts: Do you want to be notified when the current trend has a higher-than-normal probability of switching directions? Simply set up Parabolic SAR alert. Or, get notified via a Stochastic RSI alert when the market becomes overbought or oversold. MACD alerts fire each time a center line or signal line crossover occurs. Don't forget to setup an alert that fires when the Bollinger Bands are breached!\n\n- Next to the Forex pairs, all major cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), Ethereum (ETH), ...) and all major crypto exchanges (e.g. Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Huobi, Kraken, OKEX, Coinbase, Bitso, Poloniex, Bittrex, Bitcoin.co.id, and more...) are supported.\n\n- Not everybody is a programmer. Build your own indicator without programming, optionally spanning multiple charting periods.\n\n- You will be alerted in real-time when relevant price action occurs.\n\n- Setup just one alert and monitor all pairs, possibly hundreds, of an exchange.\n\nThe basic functionality of Drakdoo is free to use. There are three subscription plans that you can opt in to that enhance the basic functionality:\n\n- The Goldfish plan: next to price breach alerts, you will be able to make use of intelligent indicator alerts such as RSI. Price: $8.49 monthly, or, $68.99 annually.\n\n- The Shark plan: offering more advanced indicators, such as Ichimoku Cloud (a.o.) for advanced traders.  Price: $12.99 monthly, or, $103.99 annually.\n\n- The Whale plan: full featured functionality without compromise, including scripting your own indicator and exchange probing. Price: $16.99 monthly, or, $134.99 annually.\n\nPrices may vary depending on your country. Please refer to the plan browser available within the app for in depth plan comparisons.\n\nAll plans include a free trial of 3 days. Your iTunes account will be charged once you confirm your payment. Your subscription automatically renews. When this happens the same, the same iTunes account as the initial purchase will be charged again at the end of your subscription period unless auto-renew has been turned off in your iTunes Account Settings at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. In case of a price increase, your subscription will not automatically renew and you will be notified via your iTunes Account email address to opt-in for this increase.  In case of a price decrease, your subscription will still automatically renew, unless specified otherwise in your iTunes Account Settings. Turning off auto-renew or managing it, can be done at any time after purchase via your iTunes Account Settings.  Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.

"description":"***** \"As a former IEEE Technical Committee Chair for Signal Processing, I find this app amazingly flexible and useful. Works very well with its proper designed-in control selections.\" - Roblake \n\nSpectrum Analyzer for iOS is a powerful real-time audio analysis app. Designed with musicians and recording engineers in mind, it can also be used by anyone interested in the world of sound. Ideal for room tuning or speaker tuning, the app enables portable, precision audio measurement and visualization. \n\nFeature Highlights: \n● Octave Band Real Time Analyzer \n● FFT Plot (Fast Fourier Transform) \n● Spectrograph module \n● Test Tone and White/Pink Noise Generator \n● Native iPhone X graphics\n\n>>> Check out the demo videos at SpectrumAnalyzerApp.com \n\nAudio input may be acquired via the built-in microphone or an external measurement microphone. For best results we recommend using a calibrated measurement microphone connected via USB audio interface or iPhone dock connector.

"description":"NOTE: Use of eSignal Mobile requires a subscription to eSignal or LiveCharts, real-time streaming quotes and analysis products for the active trader.\n\neSignal Mobile provides instant access to the exchanges and services you receive on your desktop with no additional exchange fees.  By adding the eSignal Mobile service to your eSignal account you’ll also get access to QuoTrek Mobile. It is the ideal companion service to the eSignal terminal product.\n\nIts home screen provides one-view access to quotes, charts, and news, plus separate windows for Watch Lists, Detailed Quotes, News, Charts, Stock or Futures Option, Hot Lists and Company Profiles. \n\nThese app features help make for a seamless desktop to mobile experience:\n\nWatch List – Real-time or delayed quotes from the world’s exchanges. \n\nDetailed Quotes – Quote grid with instrument type-specific configurations and the ability to customize the grid with hundreds of data points. \n\nCharts – Robust streaming interactive charts with overlays, comparison studies, and a wide variety of chart aggregations and timeframes. \n\nNews – Streaming real-time news from respected sources such as Dow Jones. \n\nFundamentals – Comprehensive tearsheet profiles for stock, ETF and mutual fund securities provide fundamental and reference data for investment evaluation.\n\nOptions – Equity and futures option chains with filters for strike date, in-the-money, near-the-money and out-of-the-money views. \n\nHot Lists – wide range of preset market mover views covering most active, gainers/losers, volume and more.\n\nPreferences – Wide range of customizable options for each window type. \n\nConflation Settings – Streaming data usage can be controlled through custom data conflation settings, which allows users to control data usage (and associated cellular data costs).  Data conflation (in seconds) can be set independently for Wifi and cellular network connections. \n\nSynchronized Entitlements – All the same entitlements that govern a user’s eSignal or LiveCharts desktop account, including rights to access streaming exchange data and news content, are respected in eSignal Mobile. The same account is used to log on to desktop and mobile, ensuring a user is only logged in to on one device at any given time.
