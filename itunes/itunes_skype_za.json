"description":"Skype keeps the world talking. Say “hello” with an instant message, voice or video call – all for free*, no matter what device they use Skype on. Skype is available on phones, tablets, PCs and Macs.\n\n• Video calls – Don’t just hear the cheers, see them! Get together with 1 or 24 of your friends and family on a HD video call. Watch everyone’s smiles and cries when you tell them “We’re engaged!!!” \n• Chat – Reach people instantly. Send messages to your friends, grab someone’s attention with @ mentions or create a group chat to plan a family reunion. \n• Share – Send photos and videos with your family and friends. Save shared photos and videos to your camera roll. Share your screen to make travel plans with friends or present designs to your team.\n• Voice calls – Camera shy? Make voice calls to anyone in the world on Skype. You can also call mobile and landlines at low rates.\n• Express yourself – Liven up conversations with emoticons, click on the “+” in chat to send a Giphy or images from the web, and annotate images with words, lines and more.\n\n*Skype to Skype calls are free. Operator data charges may apply. We recommend using an unlimited data plan or WiFi connection.\n\nCall landline and device numbers and send SMS messages anywhere in the world at affordable prices using Skype. Reach non-Skype users or contacts who are not online by choosing Skype Credit or Skype subscriptions. \n \nChoose Skype Credit as a pay-as-you-go option to call and SMS. If you call specific destinations, save even more with monthly subscriptions. Skype subscriptions are monthly calling plans that let you make unlimited, or fixed-minute calls to landlines (and mobiles where applicable). Subscriptions begin at $2.99 a month for US, and can vary by destination. To make an in-app purchase, open the app, go to the Call tab and tap on the Skype to Phone banner. Skype Credit and Subscriptions purchased from the Skype app will be charged to your iTunes account when the purchase has been confirmed.\n \nYour account will be charged for Skype subscription renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. Your subscription is renewed automatically unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period of subscription.\n \nYou can manage your subscription by going to your Apple ID account settings and choosing the auto-renewal option or turning it off at any time after your purchase.\n \n• Privacy and Cookies policy: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=507539\n• Microsoft Services Agreement: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=530144", "releaseDate":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z", "primaryGenreName":"Social Networking", "primaryGenreId":6005, "bundleId":"com.skype.skype", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2019-03-12T21:18:22Z", "averageUserRating":4.0, "userRatingCount":1765},

VPN Express does exactly what, when, & how I need it for a very reasonable price. Best one out there!\"\n\n+++++ Jan 22, 2012 by Neil.D\n\"100% Perfect. 100% of the Time - This is the best VPN solution I have used. It's on my Mac, iPad and iPhone and can be used simultaneously! The pricing plans are awesome as well. Saves me a bundle.\"\n\n+++++ Jan 11, 2012 by Anthony Martinez\n\"Simple, efficient VPN. It just works. - Very easy to use with auto-configure setting. I use this all the time, and find it is great when traveling internationally or when I want greater wifi security in coffee shops. Recommended.\"\n\n+++++ Oct 17, 2011 by Computer Bear\n\"VPN Express - This app is great. Skype was blocked at the hospital where my son was in the NICU. My family and friends could not always travel the 150 mile round trip with us to see the baby. The hospitals IT director was asked to unblock Skype several times. He would not. With this app I went around the firewall. I highly recommend this app.\"", "releaseDate":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z", "primaryGenreName":"Productivity", "primaryGenreId":6007, "bundleId":"com.bestsparks.vpnclient", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2016-08-31T11:40:33Z", "averageUserRating":4.0, "userRatingCount":63},

"description":"A smarter way to book a taxi! Book your cab with Skype to avoid the expense. Use SMS booking to save money and avoid language barriers when abroad. If we can't give you such options, plain old phone booking is of course available.\n\n*** Abroad and not having internet connection? \nWhere possible, Taxican will give you a choice of providers from its on-device database (60+ cities worldwide, growing every day) with hopefully SMS option to book.\n\n*** Have internet connection, but we don't have on-device provider handy?  \nUse built-in online search for a taxi, to book just in two taps. Stores the taxicab you found for you, so you can use it next time, either you are connected or not.\n\n*** Your favorite taxi is not in the online search or on-device list?\nJust add it. All of the booking options, phone, skype, sms are available here to use if provider supports them. No need to approve anything with anyone here. If you like sharing your favorite provider with others and Taxican team, please do. Within a day we add it, so all Taxican users can use it.\n\n*** In a restaurant/office and gps is not really helpful finding your pickup address?\nTaxican integrates with Foursquare to bring you the list of pickup location candidates closest to you. You bet there is a chance the restaurant or your office will be on the list, thus giving you and a taxi driver a perfect pickup address.\n\n*** Booked for few days in advance and can't remember if booked or for when and with whom exactly?\nHistory of last 10 bookings is kept for your convenience. With pickup location if entered, pickup time, taxi provider name and city, just in case! As we are getting older at Taxican this becomes our favorite feature :).\n\n*** A word of disclaimer and encouragement\nWe will try to do our best to find your a taxi with the least expense and hurdle. Though we are just starting and your suggestions for new taxis and improvements will be greatly appreciated.", "releaseDate":"2011-08-02T12:07:07Z", "primaryGenreName":"Travel", "primaryGenreId":6003, "bundleId":"com.taxican.taxiglobal", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2011-10-05T19:38:28Z"},

"description":"WiFi on your iPhone or laptop, anywhere, anytime. Makayama has teamed up with Hotspotr.com and Free-hotspot.com to provide you with data around the world. In the US and Europe, there's a hotspot on almost every streetcorner. This app helps you find them quickly, using the built-in GPS of the iPhone. \n\nThe software leads you to the nearest of 100,000 wireless hotspots, in 15,000 cities and 132 countries, with the touch of a button. It's WiFi for Dummies. Get your mail and browse the web without being charged. The ideal WiFi-tool for frequent travellers and mobile professionals. \n\nThe app shows you the nearest free hotspot address, provides directions on Google Maps, and shows additional information, such as the hotspot provider, phone number and website. You can browse the full database manually by country and city, or choose to automatically show results based on your location.\n\nThe application doesn’t depend on WLAN scanning, which would limit the range to only 25 yards, but uses GPS to pinpoint all known hotspots up to 10 miles away. All the wireless accesspoints are locally stored on your iPhone, and GPS usage is also offline available, so no expensive data roaming is needed. When abroad, you save hundreds of dollars in roaming cost, because you will always find a broadband data connection for your laptop and iPhone.\n\nThis app will let you get your mail or surf the web as quickly as possible. Just run it and it'll connect you for to the internet. It doesn't get easier than this. \n\nPlease note: Does NOT work on iPod Touch because it has no GPS.", "releaseDate":"2009-03-14T22:58:49Z", "primaryGenreName":"Business", "primaryGenreId":6000, "bundleId":"com.makayama.FreeWifi", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2018-11-24T20:42:53Z"},

"description":"**UPDATE** PocketCam now supports audio! Support for FaceTime, iChat/Messages on macs added!\n\n** YouTube Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A69c4HHok3U\n\n** IMPORTANT ** Please turn off Bluetooth on the device (Settings->General->Bluetooth) before using PocketCam. Otherwise, you may experience frame drops/freeze. \n\nWhy paying for an expensive webcam when you can use your awesome iOS device for video conference?  Better yet, your iOS webcam is wireless!  Now you can use your iOS device to show around your house/apartment on your favorite webcam applications such as FaceTime, iChat/Messages, Windows Live or Skype.\n\nPocketCam lets you use your iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad as a wireless webcam (and microphone!) for your Windows-based computer or Mac (OS X 10.7 or above). PocketCam automatically forwards video captured by your iOS camera, which can then be used as if they come from a virtual webcam.\n\nPocketCam works with any Windows-based webcam or video conferencing applications, including instant message applications such as MSN Live Messenger, Skype, AIM, etc.  For Mac users, PocketCam works with any Mac applications that use QuickTime for video capturing, including FaceTime, iChat/Messages, GTalk, Skype and aMSN.\n\nYou can even record the live video from your iOS cam using a webcam recorder such as QuickTime Pro.\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1.  If you have not already done so, download and install the PocketControl for Windows or Mac software from our website: http://www.senstic.com/iPhone/PocketCam/PocketCam.aspx\n\n2.  On Windows, run PocketControl for Windows and make sure the PocketCam service is running on your computer.  On Mac, run PocketControl, and run any application that uses webcam and select PocketCam as your preferred webcam.\n\n3.  Start PocketCam on iOS device, and the app will automatically connect to your computer. The bottom of your iOS screen should display \"Connected to your_computer_name:port.\"\n\n4.

It’s that easy!\n\n*** #1 USA ***\n*** #1 UK ***\n*** #1 Canada ***\n*** #1 Australia ***\n*** #1 Ireland ***\n*** #1 Barbados ***\n*** #1 Mauritius ***\n*** #2 New Zealand ***\n*** #2 Venezuela ***\n*** #2 Chile ***\n*** #2 Malta ***\n*** TOP 5 Hong Kong ***\n*** TOP 5 Lebanon ***\n*** TOP 5 South Africa ***\n*** TOP 5 Cyprus ***\n*** TOP 10 Argentina ***\n*** TOP 10 Belgium ***\n*** TOP 10 Jamaica ***\n*** TOP 10 Guatemala ***\n*** TOP 10 Vietnam ***\n*** TOP 10 Nicaragua ***\n*** TOP 15 Sweden ***\n*** TOP 15 Norway ***\n*** TOP 15 Brazil ***\n*** TOP 15 Portugal ***\n*** TOP 15 El Salvador ***\n*** TOP 15 Sri Lanka ***\n*** TOP 20 Spain ***\n*** TOP 20 Azerbaijan ***\n*** TOP 20 Indonesia ***\n*** TOP 25 Jordan ***\n*** TOP 30 Mexico ***\n*** TOP 30 Egypt ***\n*** TOP 30 Taiwan ***\n*** TOP 30 Kazakhstan ***\n*** TOP 35 Italy ***\n*** TOP 35 Japan ***\n*** TOP 35 Switzerland ***\n*** TOP 50 France ***\n*** TOP 50 Romania ***\n*** TOP 50 Ecuador ***\n*** TOP 100 in over 50 Countries ***\n\n*** Spanish Language Version now available -- \"Videollamadas Con Santa\"!!! ***\n\nThere are three different calls to choose from:\n\n1) NICE CALL:  Use this any time of year, when your child has done something particularly nice, and you want to reward them by making sure Santa knows just how good they've been!  Kids love it and want to do more nice things, so they can call Santa again!\n\n2) NAUGHTY CALL:  Use this whenever your child has been naughty and you want to get them back in line by letting Santa know that they've been bad!  This really works and immediately gets kids back on track so you won't have to call Santa about them being naughty again!\n\n3) SANTA VOICE MAIL:  Santa answers his video phone with his cheery \"outgoing message\", saying he's sorry he missed your call!  Just wait for the beep, and you and your children can tell Santa anything you want!  Simple, fast, and easy!\n\n*** WATCH YOUR KIDS GO NUTS! ***", "releaseDate":"2009-12-10T17:27:51Z", "primaryGenreName":"Lifestyle", "primaryGenreId":6012, "bundleId":"com.standardmediacompany.videosanta", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2017-06-15T06:27:17Z"},
