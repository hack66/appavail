"description":"Oppdatert med støtte for Spotify!\n\nDen beste norske radio-appen for nett-radio. Bare radio. Ingen reklame i appen! Nå også 85 svenske kanaler!\n\nDe beste norske og svenske radiokanalene i en app. Over 140 kanaler. Nå som FM-nettet stenges, blir DAB og internett eneste mulighet for å høre på radio. Nettbasert radio er derfor et godt alternativ. De mest populære norske radiokanalene samlet i en app på din iPhone, iPad og Apple-TV. Alle kanalene fra NRK, P4 og Radio Norge, samt distriktskanaler og nærradio. Flere kanaler kommer etter hvert.\n\nKanalene er organisert i listene Populære, Distrikt, Andre, Svenske, Siste og alle kanaler. I tillegg kan du lage din egen favorittliste med de kanalene du ønsker.\n\nFavorittkanalene dine synkroniseres via iCloud.\n\nKobling til Spotify. Når du hører på radio i appen og den identifiserer en låt, vil det dukke opp en Spotify-meny knapp. Her kan du gå rett til låten, artisten eller albumet i Spotify. Du kan også legge låter du hører inn i en valgt spilleliste i Spotify.\n\nKjøremodus gjør det lettere å bytte kanal under kjøring.\n\nOversikten \"Akkurat nå\" viser hvilket program eller låt som spilles i øyeblikket for de fleste kanalene.\n\nAppen viser informasjon om hva som spilles på kanalen du hører på dersom dette er tilgjengelig. I tillegg viser den bilde av artist/programleder etc. fra P4 og NRK sine kanaler.\n\nDu kan fjernstyre norsk radio appen du har på din Apple-TV, Xbox eller Windows10-PC fra din iPhone/iPad. Appen finner dine enheter automatisk.\n\nAvspilling til Google Cast / Chromecast.\n\nStøtte for 3D touch snarvei til de to siste kanalene du lyttet til.\n\nFungerer flott med Bluetooth og AirPlay og viser kanalinfo/artist/program og kanal-logo på displayet i din bil eller hjemmekinoreceiver dersom dette er støttet. Neste/Forrige knapp på rattet bytter kanal i appen.\n\nAppen spiller selvsagt i bakgrunnen og fungerer med låseskjerm og info-senteret på din iPhone eller iPad. Du kan også kontrollere appen med Apple Watch.\n\nLyd og metadata for kanalene i denne appen blir strømmet fra de forskjellige radio-kanalenes offisielle internett-strømmer (i høyeste kvalitet) og er ikke denne appen sin eiendom. Takk til NRK, P4, Radio Norge og alle andre gode radiokanaler i dette landet!", "bundleId":"com.ovesen.norskradio", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2018-10-06T16:08:25Z", "averageUserRating":4.5, "userRatingCount":79},

"description":"We believe music is better with friends! JQBX lets you be a DJ, join a party, or just kick back and listen to music with friends or strangers from all over the world in real time. JQBX hooks into your Spotify account and is 100% free to use. Give it a try and start listening. Together. (Requires a Spotify Premium Account)\n\n\nHow It Works\n\n\nRoom: The place where music gets shared\nYou can create a room or join one that already exists. Rooms can be public or private and you get to decide how many DJ's can take turns playing music. You can also pick the genre and invite friends to join. Once you're in a room you can chat, DJ, listen or just kick back and enjoy the vibe.\n\n\nDJ: The tastemakers\nIf you want to share a song, just click 'be a DJ' and you will be added to the list of DJ's in the room. When it's your turn the song at the top of your queue will play for everyone in the room. If someone votes or stars your track, it will show up on your notifications.\n\n\nChat: Share your thoughts\nEach room has a dedicated chat box where you can share your thoughts about music, life, or anything else. You can single out a single person in the room by pressing the '@' button and picking them from the list. You can also embed images and all sorts of other fun stuff to make your voice heard!\n\n\nDiscover New Music\nDigging a song? Just star it and it will be saved to your starred playlist. Digging someone's vibe? You can follow them and get notified whenever they are spinning on JQBX. Loving the tracks in a room? You can export the entire track history to a playlist to relive the magic at your next party.\n\n\nCustomize Your Profile\nYou can upload unique gifs and change your username in real time to suit your mood! You can have four distinct images to reflect how you feel about a certain song that's being played.\n\n\nKeep Your Hits Organized\nAll the music you save, add to your queue, and export gets instantly added to your Spotify profile. All your music stays in the same place and can be retrieved on any Spotify enabled device.", "bundleId":"com.thebestagency.jqbx", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2018-09-04T21:00:40Z"},

"description":"Run longer, faster, and stronger with PaceDJ, the only app that modifies music BPMs to match your running pace AND allows you to create interval workouts.  There is no better running music app – Period. Get it now!\n\nRECOMMENDED BY:\n•New York Times\n•Washington Post\n•Health Magazine\n•Runner’s World \n•Men’s Health\n•Women’s Health\n•RealSimple\n•And more!\n\nWHY WE’RE BETTER THAN OTHER APPS\n\n•We're Personalized: PaceDJ lets you use the songs you have saved in your iTunes library.  This means you are in control of your playlists.  Other services provide random playlists created by DJs who don't know your tastes.  \n\n•We're Precise: Some apps claim they can serve songs at BPMs to pace you to a specific minute/mile time.  Unless they know your stride length, they can't do this accurately.   PaceDJ helps you find the right BPM first, and then fine tune to match your mile time goal.  \n\n•We're Free! Try PaceDJ for free to see how you like it!  Then upgrade to Premium for features including intervals training, dislike button, and remove ads.  \n\n•We're Unique: PaceDJ is the ONLY APP that speeds up or slows down BPMs to match your running pace AND allows you to create interval workouts.   \n\n•Like Intervals?  We've got that! Create custom interval workouts or choose from pre-programmed templates.\n\n•Each song you own can pace you at multiple levels – a massive increase in the usefulness of your music library\n\n•PaceDJ.com provides a FREE music discovery service so you can find and purchase songs that match your running pace.\n\n•Echonest song database has over 35million songs and 2.8 million artists.\n\n•Easily correct BPMs by tapping on the drum. \n\nUSER REVIEWS: \n•\"I love this app, I use it to crank up speed work for marathon training without my pace conflicting with my music!\"\n\n•\"PaceDJ allowed me to find tunes that helped me pace myself… and spend my energy focusing on…proper running form. I use PaceDJ on every run.\"\n\n•\"PaceDJ gives me that extra boost of motivation. It gives me the proper speeds I need to stay on pace and even ramp up my speed work.\"\n\nON THE WEB AT WWW.PACEDJ.COM\n\nTECHNICAL INFORMATION\nv2.0 requires iOS9.0 and higher.\n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background in PaceDJ can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE:\ncustomerservice@pacedj.com\n\n\nTHIS APP AND ANY INFORMATION GIVEN BY IT ARE NOT INTENDED NOR IMPLIED TO BE A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL ADVICE.
