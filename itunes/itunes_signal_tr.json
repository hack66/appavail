Signal is the only private messenger that uses open source and peer-reviewed cryptographic protocols to keep your messages safe.\n\n• Be Yourself - Signal uses your existing phone number and address book. There are no separate logins, usernames, passwords, or PINs to manage or lose.\n\n• Group Chat - Signal allows you to create encrypted groups so that you can have private conversations with all of your friends at once. Not only are the messages encrypted, but the Signal server never has access to any group information like the membership list, group title, or group icon.\n\n• Fast - The Signal protocol is designed to operate in the most constrained environment possible. Messages are delivered quickly and reliably.\n\n• Speak Freely - Make crystal-clear voice and video calls to people who live across town, or across the ocean, with no long-distance charges.\n\nFor support, questions, or more information, please visit:\nhttp://support.signal.org\n\nSource code:\nhttps://github.com/signalapp/Signal-iOS\n\nFollow us on Twitter (@signalapp) for all of the latest updates and announcements.", "bundleId":"org.whispersystems.signal", "trackName":"Signal - Private Messenger", "sellerName":"RIDDLE QUIET VENTURES, LLC", "genreIds":["6005", "6002"],

"description":"OpenSignal is the ultimate signal toolkit that shows you how to get a better network connection instantly, find nearby free Wifi hotspots worldwide, view signal maps so that you can compare performance of networks in your area and test the speed of your mobile or Wifi connection. \n\nUnlike other apps, which look for maximum possible speed through optimized testing, OpenSignal informs you about your true speed - what you are likely to experience when normally using your phone. Anyone using the app contributes data, informing others about real-world, not estimated, mobile performance (and we'll never ask you for personal information, just your signal strength stats).\n\nWith OpenSignal you can map cellular coverage, find Wi-Fi hotspots, test and improve your reception & get faster data.\n\n- Signal compass points you in the direction your signal is coming from \n- Speed test for download, upload and latency\n- Map of cell towers and Wifi hotspots\n- Coverage maps allow you see the best/worst places for 2G, 3G and 4G \n- Free and ad-free\n\nBased on our community-generated data we are able to help keep you better connected by giving you a practical solution to the problems of slow mobile internet. Simply follow our signal compass to walk towards better phone signal or see our in-app copoverage maps to work out which carrier is best for where you are, useful if you're thinking about switching networks. Our wifi maps help you find local public-access wireless networks (Wifi hotspots).\n\nMaps are not updated in real-time. Don’t worry though, we log the information you share with us to improve our coverage maps and performance information.

"description":"ABOUT THIS COURSE\n\nThis course introduces signal processing tools currently used in geophysics. It has been elaborated both from the book \"Signal processing for geologists and geophysicists\" (J.L. Mari, F. Glangeaud, F. Coppens, 1999) and from the CD \"Signal processing in geosciences\" (F. Glangeaud ,J.L. Mari, 2000).\n\nFor signal processing specialists, it will be a source of how classical or new theories can be applied to field data.Teaching staff should find it provides a means of tackling the teaching signal processing techniques.\n\n- - -\n\nFOREWORD\n\nThis on line course presents a succession of lessons classed by theme. The different themes that are tackled are:\n\n• The Fourier Transformation\n• Common functions in spectral analysis\n• Sampling\n• Correlation\n• Wave separation\n• Seismic applications\n• The Hilbert transformation\n• Filtering\n• Near Surface Geophysics\n• Stochastic Signal Processing\n• Attributes\n\nEach theme has an introduction and a series of lessons which are associated with it. A lesson comprises of text, a video, a formulary, if judged necessary, and in some cases an applet to practice.\n\n• The text present has been voluntarily reduced; its objective is put across by the animation. This objective may be the presentation of a specific transform used in signal processing and applied in seismic processing. The term \"transform\" is used here in a very general sense. It covers at times the notion of transformation, such as the Fourier transformation or filters such as the Wiener filter. The objective perhaps being to show the application of a \"transform\" on simulated synthetic data or on real acquired geophysical data.\n\n• The video is an illustration of the text. It permits a visualization of the data, to study the influence of processing parameters on the data. The images were conceived in a manner which permits an immediate visual comparison and that enables an evaluation of the influence of a parameter change on the data processing. If an applet is associated with the video, some parameters can be modified by moving the cursors, the calculations taking place in real time.\n\n• The formulary gives the mathematical formula used in the animation. The reader is invited to use the book cited above as a reference for the notations used and the demonstrations. The formulary should be considered as a simple memory aid.\n\nThe videos and the applets have been created thanks to the MUSTIG software ( mustig.free.fr, Gérard Lejeune).\nIn this on line course, 20 lessons can be selected. For the animations based on field data measurement, the authors or organisms that provide with them are mentioned.\n\nThis on line course does not constitute a complete course in itself ; referral to the basic signal processing texts remains essential.\n\n- - -\n\nTHE AUTHOR\n\nJean-Luc Mari is at present a geophysics professor at IFP School and an IFPEN expert.

Every detail has been optimized in order to save you time. By comparison, ReachFast is 1 to 3 times faster than other contacts apps in any given scenario.\n\n\nFeatures:\n* Pull-down to search, instead of tapping on a specific area. You can open the search without even looking at the screen.\n* Only One tap to call.\n* Two taps to Facetime.\n* Swipe right to message.\n* Favorites and Recently called contacts appear INLINE with the contacts... No need to switch tabs and the landing happens always on the recent, if you don't find the contact there, just pull down to search.\n* Smart search, that learns who you call the most and gives you the first result as a top hit, while reducing the number of letters you type before finding your contact.\n* Adding a contact is super fast. we don't stop you to ask if you are adding to existing or updating a new one, it happens along the way and reduces 3 steps out of the overall scenario.\n* While adding a contact, no need to move your finger and look at the upper screen to switch fields, you can swipe the keyboard to jump lines while keeping your fingers on the keyboard to save you time.\n* Forgot their names? View your contacts Chronologically. \n* Ability to show pictures, organize by first name, sounds, vibration, show emails etc.", "bundleId":"com.completure.com.contacts", "trackName":"Swipe To iMessage or SMS - Tap to Call & Facetime - By ReachFast Contacts", "sellerName":"Sign.al (OFFSHORE) S.A.L", "genreIds":["6007", "6002"], "releaseNotes":"- Bug Fixes", "averageUserRating":3.5, "userRatingCount":8},

Plus, easily identify areas that have yet to be tested, and be the first to put yourself on the map. \n•\tA world of results on an expanded dashboard. Your test results can tell you a great deal about your daily mobile life.

"description":"Signal Flags is an authority for identification, interpretation and use of signal flags between ships. This comprehensive app is your resource for signal flag information as specified by the International Code of Signals, the U.S. Navy, the International Sailing Federation, NATO, and Allied Forces around the world. Everything you need to know or want to know is in here.\n\n“I am a blue water sailor, cruising the East Coast of the U.S. and out to Bermuda. This app [contains] a copy of H.O. Pub 102 which is carried on the signal bridge of every commercial ship in the world. As the code meanings are uniform regardless of the nationality of the ship involved, a Portugese fisherman can use the code to request medical advice from the doctor onboard a Norwegian cruise ship even though neither speaks the other's language. Naturally, the paper copy is easier to use, but this is great in a pinch, and is a good study tool...”\n- GHK3\n\nIt's a beautiful day as you cruise the harbor in your new boat. The smell of sea water and being captain of your own vessel is pretty heady. Taking in the view, you notice a Naval ship flying unusual flags in the area you’re heading for. There’s an “A” flag, followed by a number 3 flag. You know that seafaring vessels have special signals but you don’t know what they mean. Whipping out your Signal Flags app, you quickly scroll, tapping the appropriate flags to discover that you must avoid the ship within 300 yards as they have divers in the water. You adjust your course a little to comply. Thank goodness you were able to find out before you intruded on the ship’s operation.\n\nSignal Flags have been used for communication between ships at sea since ancient times. They have evolved throughout history and now are uniformly mandated by the International Code of Signals. The flags remove the language barrier by indicating with symbols, many types of distress and information to all U.S. and Allied Forces around the globe. They are used by government, military and civilians traveling the world’s waterways.\n\nThe app contains all of the images, flags and pennants that you’ll need to know, along with detailed descriptions of their usage and meanings in international, military, and sail racing contexts. You don’t need a cumbersome book; you don’t even need an internet connection. Just pull out your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch and open Signal Flags. All the important information is contained right there in the application. Within a few seconds, you’ll know what that ship is telling you.\n\nIn addition to the signal details, this app supplies you with the complete documentation of the NIMA pub. 102 and the U.S. Department of Transportation/U.S. Coast Guard Navigation Rules (COMDTINST M16672.2D).  Both documents include extensive in-document hyperlinks for accessibility along with a specialized toolbar for quick and simple browsing.  A specialized quiz function is also provided to aid in memorization of the entire flag set. \n\n\u2028Features:\n\n* Designed and developed by a U.S. Naval Academy graduate\n* Needs no network connection once downloaded\n* Contains all current signal flag details\n* Contains complete documentation as laid out by governing sources\n* Includes a quiz function to help you memorize all the flags\n\nIf you spend time on the open water, are the employee of an organization that navigates the seas, a yacht racer, or an interested student, this application is an indispensable tool. Everything is here for you, at your fingertips, anytime, anywhere.

"description":"Speech, music, seismic vibrations, oil prices, and climate measurements are all examples of stochastic (random) signals. In this introductory textbook—intended for individuals with prior training in introductory signal processing and introductory probability theory—we present techniques to process such signals to extract useful information. We present case studies ranging from music to photographic images to oil prices to climate data to the motion of individual biomolecules. This textbook in an eBook format makes use of your device's ability to display dynamic information through films and animations and to hear the results of the techniques applied to music. At the end of every chapter there are homework problems ranging from easy to \"olympic\".\n\nA new and exciting aspect is that we make use of your tablet's interactive capabilities to present laboratory experiments in signal processing. The experiments use the graphic interface and the microphone. These experiments are not simulations; they are examples of real digital processing of signals in your mobile device.", "bundleId":"org.SocraticSoftware.iSSP", "trackName":"Stochastic Signal Processing", "sellerName":"Ian Young", "genreIds":["6017", "6018"], "releaseNotes":"• Correction of typing errors\n• Correction of typesetting errors\n• Correction of a content error\n• Improved GUI on a laboratory experiment"},

"description":"Drakdoo is a Forex & Cryptocurrency trading app that offers touch friendly charts and intelligent alerts, allowing you to stay on top of all cryptocurrencies as well as traditional markets without being glued to the screen 24/7.\n\n- Perform in-depth analysis, annotate charts, using an interface tailored for mobile.\n\n- Continuous Notifications: Next to one-time alerts that fire when a price breach occurs, we also offer continuous alerts that fire each time the price moves by a configurable threshold.\n\n- Intelligent Alerts: Do you want to be notified when the current trend has a higher-than-normal probability of switching directions? Simply set up Parabolic SAR alert. Or, get notified via a Stochastic RSI alert when the market becomes overbought or oversold. MACD alerts fire each time a center line or signal line crossover occurs. Don't forget to setup an alert that fires when the Bollinger Bands are breached!\n\n- Next to the Forex pairs, all major cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), Ethereum (ETH), ...) and all major crypto exchanges (e.g. Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Huobi, Kraken, OKEX, Coinbase, Bitso, Poloniex, Bittrex, Bitcoin.co.id, and more...) are supported.\n\n- Not everybody is a programmer. Build your own indicator without programming, optionally spanning multiple charting periods.\n\n- You will be alerted in real-time when relevant price action occurs.\n\n- Setup just one alert and monitor all pairs, possibly hundreds, of an exchange.\n\nThe basic functionality of Drakdoo is free to use. There are three subscription plans that you can opt in to that enhance the basic functionality:\n\n- The Goldfish plan: next to price breach alerts, you will be able to make use of intelligent indicator alerts such as RSI. Price: $8.49 monthly, or, $68.99 annually.\n\n- The Shark plan: offering more advanced indicators, such as Ichimoku Cloud (a.o.) for advanced traders.  Price: $12.99 monthly, or, $103.99 annually.\n\n- The Whale plan: full featured functionality without compromise, including scripting your own indicator and exchange probing. Price: $16.99 monthly, or, $134.99 annually.\n\nPrices may vary depending on your country. Please refer to the plan browser available within the app for in depth plan comparisons.\n\nAll plans include a free trial of 3 days. Your iTunes account will be charged once you confirm your payment. Your subscription automatically renews. When this happens the same, the same iTunes account as the initial purchase will be charged again at the end of your subscription period unless auto-renew has been turned off in your iTunes Account Settings at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. In case of a price increase, your subscription will not automatically renew and you will be notified via your iTunes Account email address to opt-in for this increase.  In case of a price decrease, your subscription will still automatically renew, unless specified otherwise in your iTunes Account Settings. Turning off auto-renew or managing it, can be done at any time after purchase via your iTunes Account Settings.  Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.

"description":"IMPORTANT! THIS APPLICATION IS NOT A RADIO TUNER.  YOU CANNOT LISTEN TO THE STATIONS THROUGH THIS APP.  It just helps you find the local station frequencies so that you can quickly tune your radio to the kind of station you want.\n\nI travel all over the United States for my job, and I wanted an application that would tell me the local radio stations based on my location.  Then, I would not have to waste time searching for stations in my rental car, and waiting through commercials to see what kind of station it is.\n\nI did not find any other application that worked like I wanted, so I decided to build one myself.\n\nRadioRadar Lite will use your current location (or a city location that you set), and it will display radio stations whose towers are nearby (within the range you specify).\n\nYou can filter the results by station format so, for example, you can easily find a sports station, or a Christian stations, or a jazz station.\n\nAll the radio tower information comes from a local database, so you don't have to wait for an online search.  As a bonus, you can get a tower map showing you where the towers are, and you can select a tower and go straight to the FCC information webpage for that station.\n\n*** THE LITE VERSION IS FULLY FUNCTIONAL, BUT ONLY DISPLAYS ONE STATION PER FORMAT ***\nTo see all the local stations, check out the full version of RadioRadar in the App Store.\n\n\nFEATURES:\n* Offline database for fast and reliable searches\n* Automatically use your location or pick a city\n* Identifies national networks: NPR, KLOVE, Air1 and Fox Sports\n* Choose to filter results from several station formats\n* Choose maximum distance to search for radio towers\n* See relative signal strengths to easily choose the best stations\n* Get a map view with tower locations annotated\n* Get detailed station and tower information with a focused map view\n* Tap on a tower annotation and you can choose to be taken directly to the FCC detailed information page for the selected station\n\nNOTE:\nThe station signal strength bars are only an approximation, based on the  station's broadcast power and your distance to the tower.  Terrain elements such as mountains will affect your actual signal strength.\n\nThis version only contains radio station information for stations in the United States.", "bundleId":"com.yourcompany.RadioRadar-Lite", "trackName":"RadioRadar Lite", "sellerName":"Kurt Schwartz", "genreIds":["6003", "6006"], "releaseNotes":"- Updated station database\n- New station formats\n- In addition to NPR, K-LOVE, and Air1, now shows Fox Sports affiliates"},

"description":"A background running, multitasking enabled app, that alerts you to loss of cell / wifi service!\n\nNew! Now supports EMAIL of the full data logging of loss of cell service. A full color map showing pins where each location of no cell service occurred. You can now email yourself (or anyone) a complete log sorted by date (with Carrier name) of the long/lat data and time of cell service lost.\n\nNeed to know when you lose cell phone reception? Even if your phone is in your pocket or briefcase? This is the app!\n\nWorried about the reception issues you have read about? This app is always watching for loss of reception, even when you are not looking, and will alert you if it happens. A must for people who cannot afford to miss calls! Nurses, Doctors, Police, Firefighters, Moms and Dads: Never miss that important call again because you are in a dead spot with no cell service.\n\nNote: Known limitation: If you are connected to a known WiFi network, this app cannot detect the loss of 3G/4G/LTE while connected to WiFi, I am actively working on a solution to this. For a workaround, turn off WiFi if you absolutely need to know when the cellular signal drops out at all times.\n \nDon't ever miss an important call or SMS text message again, unaware that you have no cell service. Have Cell Guardian monitor for you - from the background!\n\n** New! Mute toggle for Wifi alerts and Battery Alerts per your feedback! thank you!\n\n** New! Now with AUDIBLE Low Battery Alerts. Warns you from the background with a pop up alert, plus sound, that your battery is below 50% and then below 30% and down to 5%: This is something the iPhone does not have built in, remember the older phones that would beep to warn you of low battery? now you can have that great feature back!**\n\n**No surprise bills in the mail!**\n\nLots of download apps for music and video can seamlessly go from your home Wi-Fi to a LTE network without a hiccup, thats great, but not so great if you have a capped data plan and have to pay for that LTE time! Let this app warn you when you leave Wi-Fi for LTE every-time. \n\nYou can easily test this app by turning Airplane mode on and off while the app is running, or by turning Wi-Fi on and off. You will see the pop up alerts.\n\nAnother fun way to test this: If you use Wi-Fi at home, walk around your block and see how far you can get before the app beeps to tell you you lost your Wi-Fi connection.\n\nIf you are not on iOS 4 or later yet, you can still use our \"No Signal\" app which runs on all versions of the OS (but does not run in background mode).\n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.", "bundleId":"com.janus.", "trackName":"Signal Alert", "sellerName":"Leland Roys", "genreIds":["6002", "6000"], "releaseNotes":"Performance improvements."},

There are no audio files included in the application binary which keeps app size to a minimum and app performance to a maximum.\n\nWhat are benefits of listening to white noise?\n- Helps you sleep by blocking distractions\n- Pacifies fussy and crying babies\n- Relaxes and reduces stress\n- Increases focus while enhancing privacy\n- Soothes headaches and migraines\n- Masks tinnitus (ringing of the ears)\n\nWhat are the different sound colors?\n- White noise sounds similar to static of an analog TV or radio station that has stopped broadcasting.   White noise has equal energy across all sound frequencies.\n- Brown noise sounds like a powerful waterfall.  It has more energy at the lower frequencies and if you have a good speaker system with a subwoofer you should be able to really feel it.\n- Pink noise's upper sound frequencies don't fall off as fast as they do with brown noise, so you'll get a little more punch. The most interesting thing about pink noise is it's found in almost all electronic devices (known as flicker noise) and even in biological systems.\n- Blue and violet noise are the opposites of pink and brown noise, respectively, and sound like spraying water from a garden hose. It has more energy at the higher frequencies which means more treble and less bass. \n- Curious to learn more about color noises?  Check out this article for all the details:  http://www.tmsoft.com/white-noise-player/\n\nDirections:\nDrag the Sound Color slider to select brown, pink, white, blue, violet, or somewhere in-between.  Next, drag the low and high cut filters to further customize to your liking.  Adjust device volume using the on-screen volume slider to a comfortable level.  You can also specify to play audio to any AirPlay supported device.  Toggle audio playback using the Play/Pause button.\n\nCreated by the audio experts at TMSOFT that brought you the famous White Noise app.  Check out all our apps and sounds at http://www.tmsoft.com/", "bundleId":"com.tmsoft.NoiseGenerator", "trackName":"Noise Generator: Full Spectrum", "sellerName":"TMSOFT", "genreIds":["6002", "6020"], "releaseNotes":"Updated libraries to be GDPR compliant and other minor improvements."},

"description":"SPL Meter is a professional-grade sound level meter, also known as a decibel or dB meter, for your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nModeled after a traditional analog SPL meter, we have faithfully reproduced all the characteristics and qualities found in those meters, including the ballistics, ranges, filters, and decay rates.\n\nUnder the hood we have advanced DSP-based algorithms that meet or exceed ANSI / IEC Type 1 standards. And starting with iOS 6, we can disable the mic filters and limiters, to get the real world performance of a hand-held SPL meter.\n\nAnd now, upgrade SPL Meter with iTestMic, our pro-grade test & measurement mic, made specifically for iOS devices. Using iTestMic with SPL Meter, you get a calibrated, accurate SPL Meter, that meets industry standards for Type 2 performance. See our website for more information.\n\nBut don't compare us to a Radio Shack meter, ours is much more accurate! \n\nWe have also included a digital LCD display, as shown in the image, to make this the best SPL meter available for iPhone or iPad. And this is something that the old analog meters never had! \n\nThe screen will flip when you flip the phone over, so that you can point the iPhone mic directly at the sound source. (iPhone X does not support upside down mode)\n\nSPL Meter is a universal app -- buy once, and use on all of your iOS devices.\n\nSPL Meter is built by the same team that created the other great professional audio and acoustics apps on the store, Studio Six Digital.  Built on the engine of our more expensive \"SPL\" app, SPL Meter's filters and decay rates meet or exceed ANSI type 1. This app is not a toy or a game.\n\nSPL Meter is the one audio app that everyone who works in audio must have on their phone! Not only have we made the best one, but we've priced it so you can't afford not to get it.\n\n*** FEATURES:\n\nFILTERS -- A and C weighting filters are provided.\n\nDECAY -- Choose ANSI Fast or Slow.\n\nRANGES -- 40dB to 120dB in 9 ranges.\n\nCALIBRATION -- Comes pre-calibrated for the typical iPhone or iPad built-in and headset mic, but you can adjust the calibration if you have a professional, calibrated meter to compare it to. Accesses our cloud-based iOS device calibration database, which we updates as new devices are released.\n\nINTERNAL / EXTERNAL MIC -- Select Internal to activate the included compensation filter, which is designed to flatten the frequency response of the built-in or headset mic. External will work with our iPhone Measurement Mic, to be released later this summer. See our website for more details.\n\nSPL Meter is bargain-priced to make it easy for anyone to check out one of our professional, accurate apps. Studio Six Digital is dedicated to making the iPhone and Touch a professional audio and acoustics test device.\n\nCheck out our full line of professional-grade audio and acoustics apps: SPL, the professional digital iPhone sound level meter, SPL Graph, for recording SPL over time, RTA, a 1/3 octave real-time analyzer,  FFT, for detailed acoustic analysis, ETC, the energy-time curve function, RT60, for automated octave-band decay time measurement, Speaker Pop, to test speaker polarity, and Generator, the iPhone signal generator.\n\nAlso, if you are looking for more great acoustical and audio test apps, have a look at AudioTools, our premier app for audio professionals.", "bundleId":"com.studiosix.SPLMeter", "trackName":"SPL Meter", "sellerName":"Andrew Smith", "genreIds":["6011", "6002"], "releaseNotes":"-Updated for latest iOS and iOS devices\n-Added new device calibrations"},

"description":"***** \"As a former IEEE Technical Committee Chair for Signal Processing, I find this app amazingly flexible and useful. Works very well with its proper designed-in control selections.\" - Roblake \n\nSpectrum Analyzer for iOS is a powerful real-time audio analysis app. Designed with musicians and recording engineers in mind, it can also be used by anyone interested in the world of sound. Ideal for room tuning or speaker tuning, the app enables portable, precision audio measurement and visualization. \n\nFeature Highlights: \n● Octave Band Real Time Analyzer \n● FFT Plot (Fast Fourier Transform) \n● Spectrograph module \n● Test Tone and White/Pink Noise Generator \n● Native iPhone X graphics\n\n>>> Check out the demo videos at SpectrumAnalyzerApp.com \n\nAudio input may be acquired via the built-in microphone or an external measurement microphone. For best results we recommend using a calibrated measurement microphone connected via USB audio interface or iPhone dock connector. This allows for high precision and flat frequency response, as well as for stereo input.\n\nAudio credits:\n\"Basement Floor\" and \"Enchanted Journey\" by Kevin MacLeod\n\"Evening Birdsong\" and \"Cuckoo\" by Benboncan", "bundleId":"com.onyx3.spectrumanalyzer", "trackName":"Spectrum Analyzer RTA", "sellerName":"ONYX 3", "genreIds":["6011", "6002"],
