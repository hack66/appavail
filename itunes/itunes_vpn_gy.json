Other features include, but are not limited to:\n\n- Use VOIP service from anywhere\n- Accelerate online games: get extremely low latency when playing Order & Chaos, MetalStorm online and etc.\n- Assigns your computer a new IP address, hides your real IP to anonymize all web applications.\n- A secure encrypted connection between your computer and the Internet.\n- Secure your wireless (Wi-Fi) connection at home or at public Hotspots.\n- Unlike a proxy, you get secured connection for all programs you are using, (e.g ICQ, Email, FTP, News and anything that uses a Internet Connection)\n\nWHY USE VPN EXPRESS FOR YOUR VPN SERVICES?\n- Support All VPN Protocols available in iOS devices: IPSec, L2TP over IPSec and PPTP!\n- Lowest Rates with 24x7 availability! 99% service up time!

VPN Express does exactly what, when, & how I need it for a very reasonable price. Best one out there!\"\n\n+++++ Jan 22, 2012 by Neil.D\n\"100% Perfect. 100% of the Time - This is the best VPN solution I have used. It's on my Mac, iPad and iPhone and can be used simultaneously! The pricing plans are awesome as well. Saves me a bundle.\"\n\n+++++ Jan 11, 2012 by Anthony Martinez\n\"Simple, efficient VPN. It just works. - Very easy to use with auto-configure setting. I use this all the time, and find it is great when traveling internationally or when I want greater wifi security in coffee shops. Recommended.\"\n\n+++++ Oct 17, 2011 by Computer Bear\n\"VPN Express - This app is great. Skype was blocked at the hospital where my son was in the NICU. My family and friends could not always travel the 150 mile round trip with us to see the baby. The hospitals IT director was asked to unblock Skype several times. He would not. With this app I went around the firewall. I highly recommend this app.\"", "bundleId":"com.bestsparks.vpnclient", "sellerName":"Express Network Solutions Limited", "genreIds":["6007", "6002"], "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "minimumOsVersion":"6.0", "formattedPrice":"Free", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2016-08-31T11:40:33Z", "releaseDate":"2011-07-09T22:20:22Z", "primaryGenreName":"Productivity", "primaryGenreId":6007},

Moreover, it's suitable for travellers who need to access different kind of contents from abroad.\n \nIf you use this application you will enjoy the following features for free:\n- Your Internet access will be tunnelled over the Tor network.\n- Websites will not see your real IP address, as when you use a proxy, and the traffic from your browser would look to be originated from another place. Moreover your connection is encrypted.\n- ISPs and insecure wireless networks won't see your browsing. It will be difficult for anybody to trace your internet activities back to your device.\n- You will be able to access .onion websites which are only accessible through the TOR network.\n- Advanced browsing capability with tabs, and popover detection and blocking.\n- You can automatically delete cookies, cache and third party data on application exit.\n- Support for audio and video playback.\n- Easy to use interface: just one button to connect to the closest server!\n\nIf you purchase our Premium subscription you will also be able to enjoy the following advanced features:\n- Ads-Free experience.\n- Unlimited VPN Session duration.\n- Priority Support.\n \nVPN + TOR is the allay for data safety you can trust.

VPNHUB spoofs your IP, letting you connect from the VPN server of your choice. Forget angry border guards, VPNHUB is your diplomatic immunity to the world’s most popular sites. \n\n* Bye Bye Censorship\nWith censorship and information control on the rise, the internet can seem like a dark place. VPNHUB transforms the internet into a tool of liberation!\n \n* Avoid Getting Hacked on Public Wi-Fi\nSure it's convenient to get online using the internet at your local coffee shop, but using public Wi-Fi is like living in a glass house with no locks on the doors. Not only are you at risk of having an unwanted audience, but people can stroll right in to steal your personal data, like passwords and photos. VPNHUB encrypts all of your communications over public Wi-Fi.\n\n* Privacy Protection and Location Masking\nYour ISP may keep logs of every website you visit. Other VPNs may do it too. VPNHUB does not, end of story! It’s like wherever you browse, we’re the forensic clean-up crew covering your tracks, and then we wipe our own memories too. And not only your browsing, but we’ll mask your true location by routing your data through our full stack of encrypted global servers.  \n\n* Servers in 60+ Locations\nStandard users get unlimited access to our United States servers. That’s a decent place to start, but why stay put in one spot? Go further. Go global. Go Premium, and get access to servers from over 60 countries in far-flung lands, like from Austria to Australia, from Malaysia to Mexico, or the UK to the UAE, and beyond.\n\nVPNHUB Premium Subscription Details:\n- 7 day free trial offer is commitment free, can be cancelled anytime.\n- Payments charged to user's iTunes Account upon purchase.\n- Subscription lengths and prices: one month ($15.99), one year (89.88).\n- Auto-renewal unless cancelled 24 hours prior to subscription ending.\n- Subscriptions may be managed or cancelled through the user's Account Settings.\n- No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during an active subscription period.\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.appatomic.net/privacy_policy.php\nTerms: https://www.appatomic.net/tos.php", "bundleId":"com.appatomic.vpnhub", "sellerName":"APPATOMIC LIMITED", "genreIds":["6007", "6002"], "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "minimumOsVersion":"11.0", "formattedPrice":"Free", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2019-01-22T20:47:53Z", "releaseDate":"2018-05-23T03:36:14Z", "primaryGenreName":"Productivity", "primaryGenreId":6007},

When connecting to a VPN server through Touch VPN for example - it sets up a secured and encrypted connection to an external server. Because of the encryption process, the data cannot be filtered.\n\nWhy using a VPN: With a VPN, your online privacy and security will be greatly bolstered as you’ll be surfing the web protected.\n\nVPN vs. Proxy: VPN and Proxy can both conceal user identity through re-routing your internet traffic. A Proxy server is, however, completely browser-based, and might not be compatible with certain web pages that use non-browser technology. Unlike a Proxy, a VPN service encrypts all your traffic and will work with all internet based services. In summary, VPN will provide you with more online privacy and security.\n\nWith Touch VPN you can：\n\n* When you’re connected to a public Wi-Fi Hotspot, your name, passwords, and personal information can be easily compromised. Touch VPN encrypts your data and provides you with banking-level security for the best protection. \n\n* Touch VPN is a one-click VPN Proxy Service. Touch VPN contains only one button. The button connects you to one of many servers at speeds faster than a web proxy. When you are not running our app we help you save your device's battery.\n\n* Surf the Web Privately.  Your real IP address is concealed and your internet activity is inaccessible to prying eyes and businesses.\n\n--------------\n\nSubscription:\n\nYou can be an Elite user through auto-renewable subscription.

"description":"Everything on your iPhone or iPad uses the internet. Your email apps, web browsers, photo apps, banking apps, chat and social apps. \n\nHaving secure internet access is critical and wifi routers are hacked every day. VPN Freely will encrypt your internet traffic preventing WiFi hackers from collecting data mid-stream. It can also help you access sites that may otherwise be blocked.\n\nVPN Freely is the easiest way to secure your iPhone/iPad wifi & cellular internet activity. By simply clicking the \"Secure Me\" button you will be connected to our ultra secure Virtual Private Network. While connected you can safely surf the web, shop online and use banking apps without worry.\n\nStay Connected. Stay Safe.\n\nWhat's so great about VPN Freely?\n\n- Free iOS VPN for iPhone and iPad\n- Stealth Mode **NEW**\n- WiFi Hotspot Security\n- One Click Instant Access to Connect (No Sign-Up Required)\n- No Email, Names or Phone Numbers Required\n- 256 bit Bank Grade VPN Server Encryption\n- No Server Logs or Activity Tracking\n- We never sell user data. None of it. Ever.\n- Your internet traffic will travel over our secure IP similar to a Proxy\n- Encrypt the internet connection to your web browsers and mobile apps\n- No daily limits on usage\n- No data limits on streaming and downloads\n- Built on servers trusted by millions\n- Double the speed of your Free account by subscribing to our Newsletter\n\nAbout our Premium iOS VPN Service Subscriptions:\n\n- Go Premium to remove your speed limits and stop ads\n- Go Premium to remove the 30min session timeout \n- Go Premium to use Stealth Mode\n- Premium subscriptions are tied to your Apple ID.

However, just because your phone wants to connect to a WiFi hotspot doesn't mean it's safe. The fact is your phone can't tell you if the hotspot is safe or not. \n\nIf the hotspot is not secure other people online may be able to see your internet activity. Hackers love to sniff data on coffee shop WiFi networks because the customers feel comfortable there just like it's home. If the customer is comfortable they'll do things like personal banking online. This is why no public WiFi connection should be trusted.\n\nThe Solution = VPN Freely\n\nIt's so easy! One simple rule...\n\nAfter connecting to a Public WiFi Hotspot. Always, open your iPhone VPN Freely app (or iPad) and click \"Secure Me\". \n\nJust like that your internet access is encrypted and secured. It really is easy to surf the web safely. \n\nDownload VPN Freely today! \n\nDon't forget to try our Premium iOS VPN upgrade for free!\n\nWebsite: http://vpnfreely.com\nPrivacy Policy:  http://vpnfreely.com/privacy\nTerms of Service:  http://vpnfreely.com/terms\n\nNeed help?

"description":"Private Internet Access VPN\n\nProtect your privacy with Private Internet Access®, the world's leading VPN service for iOS users on iPhone and iPad. Private Internet Access®, or PIA, enables users to encrypt their network traffic and stay protected when online with our proxy servers. Add privacy and security to private and public networks when you browse the Internet and use WiFi, whether connected to a hotspot or at home. High speeds, unlimited bandwidth, connect with 5 devices simultaneously (smartphones, tablets, computers), no traffic logs, and 24/7 professional, native English speaking customer support.\n\nWHY USE VPN FROM PRIVATE INTERNET ACCESS®?\n\n• Low price. $3.33 per month if you purchase a yearly account ($39.99/year) or $6.99 on a monthly basis.\n• Reliable and trusted VPN provider since 2010 with a proven no log policy.\n• Privacy is our Policy. Here at PIA, we not only provide a great VPN service at a low price, but we also support organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, FightForTheFuture, Creative Commons, Open Rights Group, Index on Censorship, freenode, Wireguard, Arch Linux, and many others.\n\nWe respect your privacy and anonymity.\n\nBY USING VPN FROM PRIVATE INTERNET ACCESS®, YOU GET:\n\n• IP Cloaking. Your IP address will be changed to a Private Internet Access IP address to hide your identity and location. Hide your IP address to stop data trackers, snoopers, and hackers from tracking your browsing and search activity.\n\n• Data Encryption. Encrypt your internet traffic with our VPN proxy. Our trusted online privacy service creates several security layers which keep you anonymous and prevent access to your data. It’s time to change your WiFi habits. Don’t use WiFi without our secure VPN to proxy your internet traffic!\nWiFi Security. With WPA and WPA2 now kracked, you need a VPN to protect your WiFi everywhere - not just in hotspots, coffee shops, cafes, hotels, and airports. If you use WiFi hotspots without encryption, your data can be seen, blocked, throttled, censored, or otherwise changed.\n\n• Content Blocker. The Safari Content Blocker blocks ads, trackers, and malware while browsing with Safari.\n\nWHAT DO OUR CUSTOMERS THINK?\n\n“Firstly, the company is second to none in terms of support, troubleshooting, and individualized assistance. Their nodes and hubs are top speed. Their client is streamlined and has a tremendous ease of use.”\nJAYDLUV, 10/10/2017\n\n“This is my go to app for VPN. Been using Windows version for years and the iPad version is great.”\nPkcarreon, 09/18/2017\n\n“No hiccups, no crashes or anything. It just works great. Bear in mind you have to subscribe to the service for this to work. I highly recommend it.”\nScott Loflin, 09/15/2017\n\n“Simple and solid. No issues even when traveling.”\nJoe1134206, 09/8/2017\n\n“Love it. Feel safer when browsing the internet.”\nCachuco, 08/7/2017\n\n“Hard to find a nit with this app. (...) The iOS app allows a quicker toggle on/off than digging into settings, for VPN hostile iOS apps like Pandora and Netflix. I like PIA’s value for the money, and I have not had any trouble whatsoever with the iOS app. I recommend this app, and PIA, as one of your layers of online security.”\nDB Associates, 01/27/2017\n\n“I did my homework, reviewing many VPN services. PIA was among the most economical, plenty of simultaneous connections and more than enough servers and services. (...) The speed is more than I hoped for. I can stream all YouTube videos. HD quality is superb with no buffering. I am happy to have this extra security on all our devices. My wife could not tell the difference after I installed it on her PC. I think I paid $39.99/year. What a bargain!”\nHelmut, 06/20/2016\n\nGDPR compatibility\n\nThis application only sends username and encrypted passwords to our servers as part of using this app. During signups, we also collect user's email.

"description":"Your big screen on your pocket screen. Anywhere.\n\nRemote Desktop allows you to connect to any Windows computer using your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. The app uses Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to connect to any Windows that has support for Terminal Services.\n\nFEATURES: \n\n* It is an universal app so you only have to purchase the full version once and then use it on all your devices.\n\n* perfect for low speed connections. When you're on a slow speed network choose \"Low quality images\" and 640x480 resolution. This minimizes the required bandwith.\n\n* emulates the mouse. You can left-click, right-click and even double click. Drag & drop is also implemented.\n\n* zoom and pan the remote desktop screen as in the Safari browser.\n\n* Safari-like page view for switching between multiple concurrent sessions\n\n* connect to any version of Windows starting with XP, except all Home and Starter versions. From all these editions Microsoft removed the Terminal Services.\n\n* uses the bigger screen size of iPhone 5\n\nQUICK START GUIDE:\n\nTo start using Remote Desktop tap \"Add PC\" from the bottom toolbar. Add a name for the entry, the hostname (or IP address), your username and password and choose the image quality and resolution. Tap Save when you're done.\n\nIn the main screen you will see the new entry. Tap on it to connect, swipe it to delete it or tap the disclosure icon to edit the computer's informations.\n\nOn slow network connections choose low image quality and a low resolution to insure proper screen updates. Also be aware that iPod Touches tend to work slow when choosing higher image resolutions.\n\nBUY ONCE, USE IT ON ALL YOUR DEVICES:\n\nThe app is free so you can download it and test it with your PCs configuration without having to pay in advance. If it works with your configuration (routers, firewalls, etc) then you can disable the ads by purchasing an in-app product that costs 0.99$. The app in it's free version is a fully functional app, so you can test every option before deciding to buy.\n\nAfter purchasing the in-app feature on one device, you can disable the banners on all your devices (iPads, iPhones, iPod Touches) without having to pay again, as long as you use the same iTunes account. To do this you have to go through the purchase process on each additional device. Hit 'Disable Ads', confirm the purchase and a message from iTunes will confirm you already bought the product and the banners will be disabled.\n\n************************** \nIf the ads are shown again after a reinstall go through the purchase process again to remove them. You won't be charged again. This only re-activates the in-app product on the device.\n**************************\n\nVERSION HISTORY: \n\nVersion 1.1:\n* added a new scissor icon in the upper toolbar when a connection is open and active. When touched it brings up a set of text edit commands: CTRL+C (Copy), CTRL+X (Cut), CTRL+V (Paste), CTRL+Z(Undo), CTRL+F (Find), CTRL+R (Replace). \n\n* added a new setting to the connection settings: Use Console. Enable this switch if you want to connect to the console session. \n\nVersion 1.2:\n* updated the screen size to take advantage of the larger screen of iPhone 5\n\n***********************************\nPlease read our Support section at \nhttp://rdp.bamtoo.com/support/ \nor email us if you can't connect to your PC. And make sure you activated Remote Desktop Services in your Windows system, you connect to your external IP address and you forwarded calls to RDP port if you use a wireless router in your home.\n***********************************", "bundleId":"ro.evolve.rdp", "sellerName":"Evolve Networks", "genreIds":["6007", "6002"], "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "minimumOsVersion":"4.3", "formattedPrice":"Free", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2014-03-27T22:24:13Z", "releaseDate":"2012-03-06T02:47:52Z", "primaryGenreName":"Productivity", "primaryGenreId":6007},

You can now block all cookies. This was one of the things we had to basically rebuild from scratch when we switched browser engines to WKWebView back in December. So it’s all very new and shiny and modern and new we would appreciate it if you didn’t scratch the paintwork. \n- Bookmarks are easier to use. \n- Everyone hates it when Brave crashes, so we made that happen less. It’s more complicated than it sounds.\n- iPads are supposed to look big and beautiful, but we weren’t looking as beautiful as we wanted. A little UI self-care and we’re pretty as ever.\n- Our translations needed a whole lot of love. Now they only need a lot of love. We’re trying, we promise!\n\nAs ever, thanks for using Brave. If you’ve got any questions or comments, check out https://community.brave.com, or you can reach us directly at http://brave.com/msupport or support+ios@brave.com where we 100% guarantee that an actual human person will definitely read your email.", "currency":"USD", "wrapperType":"software", "version":"1.8", "artistId":1052874328, "artistName":"Brave Software", "genres":["Utilities", "Productivity"], "price":0.00, 
"description":"Brave Web Browser is a faster, free, secure web browser for iOS with a built-in AdBlocker that prevents tracking and provides security protection, and optimized data and battery experience.\n\nADBLOCKING\nBrave adblocker browser is designed with a built-in Ad Block to provide an ad-free and seamless browsing experience.\n\nFAST & SECURE\nNo external plugins or settings to manage or configure! Brave simply provides the fastest and most secure browsing experience available for iOS. Brave is designed for both speed and security, so you can enjoy lightning fast browsing without popups, malware and other annoyances.\n\nBATTERY & DATA OPTIMIZATION\nBrave reduces page loading time, improves performance, and guards from ads infected with malware. Brave shows a 2x to 8x speed increase on iOS, so you will see a direct reduction in both battery and data plan consumption.\n\nPRIVACY PROTECTION\nThe Brave privacy browser also protects users with leading privacy and security features such as HTTPS Everywhere (encrypted data traffic), script blocking, cookie blocking, and private incognito tabs. Others, including Firefox, Opera, Chrome, Aloha, Ghostery and the Dolphin browsers, fall short of the level of privacy and security protection that Brave provides. \n\nBrave for iOS has the following features:\n* Built-in Ad-Block\n* Pop-up blocker\n* Saves data, Saves money\n* Battery optimization\n* Data optimization\n* Tracking Protection\n* Https Everywhere (for security)\n* Script Blocking\n* Bookmarks \n* History\n* Private tabs\n* Recent tabs\n\nHow to get started? \nEasy! Just click on the lion head and discover Brave Shields, which have per-site settings so you can decide which sites to block.\n\nAbout Brave\nWe have a mission to save the web by increasing browsing speed and safety for users, while growing ad revenue share for content creators.\n\nThe web has become a different place. With the ad-tech ecosystem out of control, users have revolted and blocking ads has become the new weapon of choice for improving their browsing speed, safety and privacy. Unfortunately, blocking alone results in a race to the bottom where nobody wins. Without the ability for content creators to earn money for their efforts, users could be left with fewer sites to browse, relegated to hand-picked content from controlled sources.\n\nBrave aims to transform the online ad ecosystem with micropayments and a new revenue-sharing solution to give users and publishers a better deal, where fast, safe browsing is the path to a brighter future for the open web.\n\nTo learn more about Brave web browser which has a built-in AdBlocker, tracking and security protection, and optimized data and battery experience, please go to https://www.brave.com\n\nSupport: If you have any questions or recommendations, please feel free to reach out to us at community.brave.com", "bundleId":"com.brave.ios.browser", "sellerName":"Brave Software, Inc.", "genreIds":["6002", "6007"], "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "minimumOsVersion":"12.0", "formattedPrice":"Free", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2019-03-01T16:48:44Z", "releaseDate":"2016-02-19T18:55:32Z", "primaryGenreName":"Utilities", "primaryGenreId":6002},
