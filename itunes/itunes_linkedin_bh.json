"description":"Eight is the ultimate business card organizer and professional networking platform. Used by over 2 million people, Eight is an easy, convenient & completely free-to-use app.\n\nSimply scan in any visiting cards you receive, and see them instantly put into a digital business cards holder. Eight uses a proprietary combination of OCR technology & human input to accurately digitize each card into a unique Eight profile, giving users a convenient database of their professional network with 99.9% accuracy!\n\nEight is also a powerful professional network and enables you to network with scanned business cards on the app. From a contact's profile, you can call, email, or view their address on a map. Eight users can share news & updates with their Eight network or even interact with each other through instant messages. \n\nWhy Eight?\n-\tIt scans business cards with 99.9% accuracy using both OCR & human transcription thus helping users to manage contacts and stay linked in conveniently and easily.\n-\tThe standard version is free and includes scanning, organizing features. \n-\tUsers can purchase Eight Premium for quicker digitization and more benefits.\n-\tUsers can sync their networks to their devices. Data is also automatically updated if connected contacts change the details on their business card.\n\nWhat Eight has in store for you:\n\n- Organize business cards & professional networks: \nUsers often have a large stack of disorganized visiting cards & biz cards making them difficult to use and refer to. Eight is a free digital card holder that solves this problem by removing the need for manual entry. Now using your mobile cam, cards will be instantly digitized into an e visiting card, and you will be able to see full information of the card on the app. Additionally, once digitized, Eight lets users add notes & tags on profiles so they can manage contacts & organize their business & professional network efficiently. It's a digital card scanner, holder, reader & organizer consolidated in a single app.\n\n- Manual input to ensure superior accuracy: \nEight uses a combination of OCR technology & human resources to digitize business cards from a scanned image into a digital Eight profile. After users scan their biz cards, Eight uses OCR technology to instantly read the data on the visiting cards, which is then manually checked & corrected by our team, ensuring 99.9% accuracy even for the most hard-to-read cards. It's a perfect digital card maker as it easily converts visiting cards to e biz cards.\n\n- Easy search feature to find & reach contacts from within the app: \nThis is not your regular visiting cards scanner or digital business card holder. It allows users to manage contacts & contact them via email or phone, helping them unlock new business & career opportunities. It is especially helpful for salespeople and salesforce users to manage & convert leads.\n\n- Free to use basic app with an option to buy premium features: \nThe standard version of the app is free to use and has all the essential functions that make Eight a powerful business solution. Users can purchase Eight Premium for additional benefits including an ability to export their data (e.g. phonebook sync). It not only helps users to convert their visiting cards & biz cards into e business cards using OCR but also lets them export their e business card data to their devices.\n\n- Networking: Eight stands out among others as it not only scans your business cards but also lets you stay linked in with your contacts who are themselves Eight users, by providing options such as private instant chat messaging and an activity feed thus providing you with ample business opportunities and timely updates from your network.\n\nHow does Eight compare to alternatives?\nCamcard: Camcard and most other scanners only uses OCR, not human input, causing significantly lower accuracy.\nBric: Bric and others have scan limits, following which you have to pay. Eight is totally free and unlimited.", "bundleId":"net.8card.eight", "genreIds":["6000", "6002"], "releaseDate":"2017-10-12T08:26:32Z", "primaryGenreName":"Business", "primaryGenreId":6000},

"releaseNotes":"• In order to improve security and address user feedback, Kalido no longer automatically adds users as your contacts based on phone book data\n• Now you’ll see a “My Personal Network” network, which lets you individually manage your personal connections by sending and accepting requests\n• When expanding your personal network, you can now search for anyone in your existing networks, and anyone else who has chosen to be findable on Kalido, and request to add them. Once you’ve made a request, and the other person has accepted, they will be part of your personal network\n• In Settings, you can manage your search visibility, to choose whether anyone can find you, or only people in your networks\n• We have replaced the default public environment that all users previously belonged to with a set of geographic networks: These networks are automatically created for countries, cities, and neighbourhoods where Kalido users are active. Anyone can join these networks, allowing everyone an easy way to understand the communities around them. For companies and schools, this also means that during onboarding, a user can choose to join only your private network, creating the option of a completely private Kalido experience for them from Day One\n• Private network admins can now specify an email domain (e.g. my company.com) that will allow anyone with an @mycompany.com email address to automatically join a specific private network\n• When signing up, in addition to adding any custom skill you want, we’ve made it easier to select skills you have, and skills you are looking for, from a curated list\n• When signing up,  we now suggest people that you might know, to make building your personal network easier\n• To improve navigation, the bottom tab bar is now visible at all times, unless you are in an uninterruptible flow (e.g. when recommending someone, introducing someone, or adding a skill, search or interest to your profile). This means you can now navigate into a screen within the Networks tab, and still have one-tap access to the Nearby tab, for example.\n• Our matching AI has learned to be better and faster, so now you'll get higher quality matches in less time across a broader set of skill concepts\n• Improved performance for chat, matching, network, and nearby views, making it easier to interact with networks that have thousands of members\n• More than 100 small bug fixes and minor experience improvements across the board", "minimumOsVersion":"10.0", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "sellerName":"OM Mobile Ventures LLC", "formattedPrice":"Free", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2019-03-13T12:58:11Z", "currency":"USD", "wrapperType":"software", "version":"1.65", "trackId":961851767, "trackName":"Kalido: Business Network, Jobs", "artistId":961851766, "artistName":"Om Mobile Ventures", "genres":["Business", "Social Networking"], "price":0.00, 
"description":"Your network is one of your most valuable assets. At its full potential, it can unlock a whole world of opportunities. But if you’re like most people, building, maintaining, and getting value from your networks is hard. You are surrounded by opportunities: but to capture them, you need a way to see them. Kalido works constantly to help you uncover opportunities to use your skills; find people who have skills you need; and expand your network in ways that create value for you and the people you add.\n\nThis empowers you to offer skills and services, find skilled professionals and meet potential clients, with trust at the core of every interaction. Simply by responding to two simple prompts “I want to meet…” and “I can provide…” and sharing your contacts, you unleash the power of Kalido to find unique and trusted matches for you.\n\nKalido drives incredible networking value for enterprises, schools, conference organisers and attendees.  For enterprises: Kalido enables better onboarding for new joiners (including temporary hires like freelancers and consultants). For schools, Kalido allows alumni to stay connected wherever they are in the world, hire each other more easily, and get introductions and referrals to trusted and skilled people through a community they trust. For conference organisers, attendees find live networking opportunities through immediate matching and browsing, so they can meet, converse and exchange value in minutes.  For everyone else, Kalido removes the middleman, and replaces anonymous reviews with trusted recommendations.\n\nKalido acts as your marketplace for people.  It will find you an awesome local web designer, it will allow you to introduce your friend, who is a freelance photographer, to your private trusted network of local entrepreneurs. It will allow you to make money from your hobby and introduce you to people looking for your skills. Kalido will tell you when a friend or colleague is nearby so you can catch up for that overdue coffee which may lead to a big career opportunity you hadn’t even thought of. It will do all of this, perpetually, infinitely, daily. For free.\n\nWe believe that there should be a level playing field and people should have the environment to create opportunity for themselves no matter who they are.  That’s why we built Kalido.\n\n● Nearby: You are surrounded by talented individuals who can offer useful skills, and Kalido can help you discover them. More importantly, it can help you be discovered too, maybe for local jobs or freelance opportunities. No matter where you are in the world Kalido will tell you who’s around.\n\n● Networks: Join networks to see and match with relevant people nearby, wherever you are in the world. Search and share opportunities with fellow alumni and colleagues. Meet up, chat with, and get introductions to new business clients, professionals, or other alumni. Create your own customised and secure private network and invite colleagues and friends to join.\n\n● Introductions: Do you have a connection who needs to hire a photographer for an upcoming project? Perhaps your friend is a freelance photographer? Why not introduce them to each other online? Kalido gives you the ability to refer and be referred because everybody knows someone.\n\n● Chat: Call, text, or meet up with your matches and trusted contacts directly. Use pre-defined icebreakers to help you get things off the ground and network.\n\n● Trusted matches: we match you with the right people, enabling freelancers to meet new clients, start networking, outsource and succeed in their career. We prioritize matches who have shared contacts, shared networks and are nearby.\n\n● Offer freelancing services: we provide business and job opportunities to freelancers and small businesses to offer their services. Freelancers can meet professional clients who value their work and get jobs at a fair price. Kalido will be your online cv to showcase your skills and experience.", "bundleId":"net.ommobile.samui", "genreIds":["6000", "6005"], "releaseDate":"2015-10-29T14:19:21Z", "primaryGenreName":"Business", "primaryGenreId":6000},

"description":"SparksFly™ simplifies and unifies the repeated steps you take participating in all your social feeds. One app, one screen lets you view and post all user-content regardless of what social media platform is it on. You gain “intelligent control” over searching, sorting and curating all of your feeds - control to know something before others do, to know more than others do - control to be more well-informed all from what is already flowing through your social mobile apps. SparksFly™ brings people, brands, ideas and relevant real-time information closer together than ever before. \n\nSparksFly™ Patent-pending Artificial Intelligence \nWe took another GIANT leap forward in the evolution of social media by applying our multi-patent-pending AI Engine to all the content across your selected social networks within the SparksFly™ app. Our engine “discovers and surfaces” uniquely relevant pieces of content, facts, trends, places, people, topics and ideas, “Sparks”, that would have been impossible to discover on your own culling through thousands of posts across multiple social networks in real time. The more our AI engine learns about what you do, like and dislike in your feeds, the brighter and more frequent the “Sparks” fly. Sparks come from from the collection of content flowing through ALL of your feeds together NOT Twitter, or Facebook, or Instagram, etc. separately. \n\nSparksFly’s™ single screen and individualized AI engine enable anyone who uses more than one social network to keep up with ALL content and get ahead of its collective meaning. It's a MUST HAVE for those who use social to be in-the-know or want to be one of the first-to-know without the massive time commitment required today. \n\nSocial simplified. It's about time.\n\nGet the App Now!", "bundleId":"com.sparksfly.iphone", "genreIds":["6005", "6012"], "releaseDate":"2013-10-30T07:00:00Z", "primaryGenreName":"Social Networking", "primaryGenreId":6005},

"description":"This app beautifully displays quotes from all over the world to help you get motivation to work.You can choose to use the app simply as it is, or customize to your liking using more than ten features (most number of features for a quotes app). \nWe have been receiving great reviews, with an average of 4.7 stars.\n\n[List of functions]\n\n- Quote display\n- Favorites\n- Autoplay\n- Background and text design customization\n- Play only favorites\n- VoiceOver\n- Regular notification with your favorite quote\n- BGM\n- Snow animation\n- ... and many more (details below in [Function Details]!)\n\n[Function Details]\n\n- Quote display\n\nWe will deliver only the best quotes, carefully picked from around the world. Every time you press the switch in the Quotes page, a new inspirational quote appears.\nQuotes will be added regularly, and you don't have to update the app to get them. You could also switch between different languages at any point from the Settings page (left swipe from the Quotes page).\n\n- Favorites\n\nYou can \"favorite\" a quote by tapping the star icon in the Quotes page. \nYou can see your favorites list from the Settings page. You could also display only the favorites during Autoplay (when using Autoplay feature), or set a quote from your favorites list as a notification message.\n\n- Autoplay\n\nYou could let the app do the switching by tapping the triangle button on the Quotes page. If you feel tired of pressing the switch every time, please try this function. While the triangle icon is rotating, it is in Autoplay mode. You could end Autoplay mode by tapping anywhere on the screen. You could also change the time interval for Autoplay from the Settings page. Autoplay can be used at the same time as VoiceOver.\n\n- Background and text design customization\n\nSwipe to the right to go to the Design Settings page. You could change background image and text design to your liking. Go ahead and look for your favorite combination of background, text color, and text shadow color. \nTip: It tends to look good if you choose the same color for both text color and text shadow color.\nText size can be changed from the Settings page.\n\n- VoiceOver\n\nUnlike any other quotes app, we have VoiceOver function (reading the quotes out loud). This feature is compatible in Japanese and English.\nPlease do understand that it may sound mechanical at times. You could change the overall tone of the voice from the Settings page.\n\n- Regular notification\n\nGo to Settings -> xxx time -> \"choose message\" to register a message from your favorites list as a notification message. Use this to remind and motivate yourself each day.\n\n- BGM\n\nHow about reading inspirational quotes while listening to calm, natural background music? You can choose from three types of sounds from the nature from the Settings page. You could use this to relax before going to bed.\n\n- Snow animation\n\nAs a small gift to users, we prepared a snow animation. Go to the Settings page and turn the feature on, go back to the Quotes page, and let the sakura fall gently down your screen. True, it might block your view a little. But I think it is sometimes nice to feel the nature while reading inspirational quotes. \n\n- Share with friends\n\nTap the arrow icon on the Quotes page, to show a selection of media to share. Currently we have twitter, facebook and LINE. \nYou could also save the image to your camera roll. Turn on your friend's \"switch\" by sharing your favorite quote. \n\n- Finally\n\nThere are more features than what we have explained above, and we are certain that this app will satisfy any quote lover.\nWe are also doing regular updates to accommodate to the latest OS and features. Please try this app out and see how you like it.", "bundleId":"com.chocofactory.BusinesSwitch", "genreIds":["6000", "6007"], "releaseDate":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z", "primaryGenreName":"Business", "primaryGenreId":6000},

Or even just the person you met while you were out at dinner last night with that amazing job opportunity? Chances are, you have a pile of business cards that you’re afraid to throw away because there’s definitely a possibility that you might reach out to one of them for something. But what do you do with them in the meantime?\n\nNot to mention those times when you met that perfect business contact but you just realized you forgot to restock your own cards in your wallet! That cocktail napkin with your phone number will definitely hold up in their pocket. Right.\n\nWhy not just skip the entire process? Everything else is digital nowadays – shouldn’t one of the most obnoxious business trends finally evolve as well?\n\nSwoopMeet completely takes away the necessity to carry a business card.
