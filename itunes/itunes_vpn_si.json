Nowadays, anonymous surfing on the web is increasingly important in order to protect your personal data 360 degrees. This is valid not only when you browse incognito from a laptop, but also when you use your iPhone and you want to shield your private informations. The TOR (The Onion Router) Network protects you by bouncing your communications around a distributed network of relays run by volunteers all around the world: it prevents somebody watching your Internet connection from learning what sites you visit, and it prevents the sites you visit from learning your physical location. Moreover, it's suitable for travellers who need to access different kind of contents from abroad.\n \nIf you use this application you will enjoy the following features for free:\n- Your Internet access will be tunnelled over the Tor network.\n- Websites will not see your real IP address, as when you use a proxy, and the traffic from your browser would look to be originated from another place. Moreover your connection is encrypted.\n- ISPs and insecure wireless networks won't see your browsing. It will be difficult for anybody to trace your internet activities back to your device.\n- You will be able to access .onion websites which are only accessible through the TOR network.\n- Advanced browsing capability with tabs, and popover detection and blocking.\n- You can automatically delete cookies, cache and third party data on application exit.\n- Support for audio and video playback.\n- Easy to use interface: just one button to connect to the closest server!\n\nIf you purchase our Premium subscription you will also be able to enjoy the following advanced features:\n- Ads-Free experience.\n- Unlimited VPN Session duration.\n- Priority Support.\n \nVPN + TOR is the allay for data safety you can trust. Download it now and secure your mobile browser: it's fast and easy, you just need to tap a button to enjoy full anonymity. Be untraceable wherever you are, choose unlimited privacy and security!\n\n-------------------\nSUBSCRIPTION INFO:\n\nSubscribe to take advantage of all the features described above.\n• Subscription length: weekly, monthly, yearly\n• Your payment will be charged to your iTunes Account as soon as you confirm your purchase.\n• You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal from your Account Settings after the purchase.\n• Your subscription will renew automatically, unless you turn off auto-renew at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n• The cost of renewal will be charged to your account in the 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n• When canceling a subscription, your subscription will stay active until the end of the period.

Other features include, but are not limited to:\n\n- Use VOIP service from anywhere\n- Accelerate online games: get extremely low latency when playing Order & Chaos, MetalStorm online and etc.\n- Assigns your computer a new IP address, hides your real IP to anonymize all web applications.\n- A secure encrypted connection between your computer and the Internet.\n- Secure your wireless (Wi-Fi) connection at home or at public Hotspots.\n- Unlike a proxy, you get secured connection for all programs you are using, (e.g ICQ, Email, FTP, News and anything that uses a Internet Connection)\n\nWHY USE VPN EXPRESS FOR YOUR VPN SERVICES?\n- Support All VPN Protocols available in iOS devices: IPSec, L2TP over IPSec and PPTP!\n- Lowest Rates with 24x7 availability! 99% service up time!

VPN Express does exactly what, when, & how I need it for a very reasonable price. Best one out there!\"\n\n+++++ Jan 22, 2012 by Neil.D\n\"100% Perfect. 100% of the Time - This is the best VPN solution I have used. It's on my Mac, iPad and iPhone and can be used simultaneously! The pricing plans are awesome as well. Saves me a bundle.\"\n\n+++++ Jan 11, 2012 by Anthony Martinez\n\"Simple, efficient VPN. It just works. - Very easy to use with auto-configure setting. I use this all the time, and find it is great when traveling internationally or when I want greater wifi security in coffee shops. Recommended.\"\n\n+++++ Oct 17, 2011 by Computer Bear\n\"VPN Express - This app is great. Skype was blocked at the hospital where my son was in the NICU. My family and friends could not always travel the 150 mile round trip with us to see the baby. The hospitals IT director was asked to unblock Skype several times. He would not. With this app I went around the firewall. I highly recommend this app.\"", "genreIds":["6007", "6002"], "bundleId":"com.bestsparks.vpnclient", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "sellerName":"Express Network Solutions Limited", "releaseNotes":"Bug fixes", "minimumOsVersion":"6.0"},

"description":"Your big screen on your pocket screen. Anywhere.\n\nRemote Desktop allows you to connect to any Windows computer using your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. The app uses Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to connect to any Windows that has support for Terminal Services.\n\nFEATURES: \n\n* It is an universal app so you only have to purchase the full version once and then use it on all your devices.\n\n* perfect for low speed connections. When you're on a slow speed network choose \"Low quality images\" and 640x480 resolution. This minimizes the required bandwith.\n\n* emulates the mouse. You can left-click, right-click and even double click. Drag & drop is also implemented.\n\n* zoom and pan the remote desktop screen as in the Safari browser.\n\n* Safari-like page view for switching between multiple concurrent sessions\n\n* connect to any version of Windows starting with XP, except all Home and Starter versions. From all these editions Microsoft removed the Terminal Services.\n\n* uses the bigger screen size of iPhone 5\n\nQUICK START GUIDE:\n\nTo start using Remote Desktop tap \"Add PC\" from the bottom toolbar. Add a name for the entry, the hostname (or IP address), your username and password and choose the image quality and resolution. Tap Save when you're done.\n\nIn the main screen you will see the new entry. Tap on it to connect, swipe it to delete it or tap the disclosure icon to edit the computer's informations.\n\nOn slow network connections choose low image quality and a low resolution to insure proper screen updates. Also be aware that iPod Touches tend to work slow when choosing higher image resolutions.\n\nBUY ONCE, USE IT ON ALL YOUR DEVICES:\n\nThe app is free so you can download it and test it with your PCs configuration without having to pay in advance. If it works with your configuration (routers, firewalls, etc) then you can disable the ads by purchasing an in-app product that costs 0.99$. The app in it's free version is a fully functional app, so you can test every option before deciding to buy.\n\nAfter purchasing the in-app feature on one device, you can disable the banners on all your devices (iPads, iPhones, iPod Touches) without having to pay again, as long as you use the same iTunes account. To do this you have to go through the purchase process on each additional device. Hit 'Disable Ads', confirm the purchase and a message from iTunes will confirm you already bought the product and the banners will be disabled.\n\n************************** \nIf the ads are shown again after a reinstall go through the purchase process again to remove them. You won't be charged again. This only re-activates the in-app product on the device.\n**************************\n\nVERSION HISTORY: \n\nVersion 1.1:\n* added a new scissor icon in the upper toolbar when a connection is open and active. When touched it brings up a set of text edit commands: CTRL+C (Copy), CTRL+X (Cut), CTRL+V (Paste), CTRL+Z(Undo), CTRL+F (Find), CTRL+R (Replace). \n\n* added a new setting to the connection settings: Use Console. Enable this switch if you want to connect to the console session. \n\nVersion 1.2:\n* updated the screen size to take advantage of the larger screen of iPhone 5\n\n***********************************\nPlease read our Support section at \nhttp://rdp.bamtoo.com/support/ \nor email us if you can't connect to your PC. And make sure you activated Remote Desktop Services in your Windows system, you connect to your external IP address and you forwarded calls to RDP port if you use a wireless router in your home.\n***********************************", "genreIds":["6007", "6002"], "bundleId":"ro.evolve.rdp", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "sellerName":"Evolve Networks",

A Proxy server is, however, completely browser-based, and might not be compatible with certain web pages that use non-browser technology.

"description":"Private Internet Access VPN\n\nProtect your privacy with Private Internet Access®, the world's leading VPN service for iOS users on iPhone and iPad. Private Internet Access®, or PIA, enables users to encrypt their network traffic and stay protected when online with our proxy servers. Add privacy and security to private and public networks when you browse the Internet and use WiFi, whether connected to a hotspot or at home. High speeds, unlimited bandwidth, connect with 5 devices simultaneously (smartphones, tablets, computers), no traffic logs, and 24/7 professional, native English speaking customer support.\n\nWHY USE VPN FROM PRIVATE INTERNET ACCESS®?\n\n• Low price. $3.33 per month if you purchase a yearly account ($39.99/year) or $6.99 on a monthly basis.\n• Reliable and trusted VPN provider since 2010 with a proven no log policy.\n• Privacy is our Policy. Here at PIA, we not only provide a great VPN service at a low price, but we also support organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, FightForTheFuture, Creative Commons, Open Rights Group, Index on Censorship, freenode, Wireguard, Arch Linux, and many others.\n\nWe respect your privacy and anonymity.\n\nBY USING VPN FROM PRIVATE INTERNET ACCESS®, YOU GET:\n\n• IP Cloaking. Your IP address will be changed to a Private Internet Access IP address to hide your identity and location. Hide your IP address to stop data trackers, snoopers, and hackers from tracking your browsing and search activity.\n\n• Data Encryption. Encrypt your internet traffic with our VPN proxy. Our trusted online privacy service creates several security layers which keep you anonymous and prevent access to your data. It’s time to change your WiFi habits. Don’t use WiFi without our secure VPN to proxy your internet traffic!\nWiFi Security. With WPA and WPA2 now kracked, you need a VPN to protect your WiFi everywhere - not just in hotspots, coffee shops, cafes, hotels, and airports. If you use WiFi hotspots without encryption, your data can be seen, blocked, throttled, censored, or otherwise changed.\n\n• Content Blocker. The Safari Content Blocker blocks ads, trackers, and malware while browsing with Safari.\n\nWHAT DO OUR CUSTOMERS THINK?\n\n“Firstly, the company is second to none in terms of support, troubleshooting, and individualized assistance. Their nodes and hubs are top speed. Their client is streamlined and has a tremendous ease of use.”\nJAYDLUV, 10/10/2017\n\n“This is my go to app for VPN. Been using Windows version for years and the iPad version is great.”\nPkcarreon, 09/18/2017\n\n“No hiccups, no crashes or anything. It just works great. Bear in mind you have to subscribe to the service for this to work. I highly recommend it.”\nScott Loflin, 09/15/2017\n\n“Simple and solid. No issues even when traveling.”\nJoe1134206, 09/8/2017\n\n“Love it. Feel safer when browsing the internet.”\nCachuco, 08/7/2017\n\n“Hard to find a nit with this app. (...) The iOS app allows a quicker toggle on/off than digging into settings, for VPN hostile iOS apps like Pandora and Netflix. I like PIA’s value for the money, and I have not had any trouble whatsoever with the iOS app. I recommend this app, and PIA, as one of your layers of online security.”\nDB Associates, 01/27/2017\n\n“I did my homework, reviewing many VPN services. PIA was among the most economical, plenty of simultaneous connections and more than enough servers and services. (...) The speed is more than I hoped for. I can stream all YouTube videos. HD quality is superb with no buffering. I am happy to have this extra security on all our devices. My wife could not tell the difference after I installed it on her PC. I think I paid $39.99/year. What a bargain!”\nHelmut, 06/20/2016\n\nGDPR compatibility\n\nThis application only sends username and encrypted passwords to our servers as part of using this app. During signups, we also collect user's email.

"description":"Brave Web Browser is a faster, free, secure web browser for iOS with a built-in AdBlocker that prevents tracking and provides security protection, and optimized data and battery experience.\n\nADBLOCKING\nBrave adblocker browser is designed with a built-in Ad Block to provide an ad-free and seamless browsing experience.\n\nFAST & SECURE\nNo external plugins or settings to manage or configure! Brave simply provides the fastest and most secure browsing experience available for iOS. Brave is designed for both speed and security, so you can enjoy lightning fast browsing without popups, malware and other annoyances.\n\nBATTERY & DATA OPTIMIZATION\nBrave reduces page loading time, improves performance, and guards from ads infected with malware. Brave shows a 2x to 8x speed increase on iOS, so you will see a direct reduction in both battery and data plan consumption.\n\nPRIVACY PROTECTION\nThe Brave privacy browser also protects users with leading privacy and security features such as HTTPS Everywhere (encrypted data traffic), script blocking, cookie blocking, and private incognito tabs. Others, including Firefox, Opera, Chrome, Aloha, Ghostery and the Dolphin browsers, fall short of the level of privacy and security protection that Brave provides. \n\nBrave for iOS has the following features:\n* Built-in Ad-Block\n* Pop-up blocker\n* Saves data, Saves money\n* Battery optimization\n* Data optimization\n* Tracking Protection\n* Https Everywhere (for security)\n* Script Blocking\n* Bookmarks \n* History\n* Private tabs\n* Recent tabs\n\nHow to get started? \nEasy! Just click on the lion head and discover Brave Shields, which have per-site settings so you can decide which sites to block.\n\nAbout Brave\nWe have a mission to save the web by increasing browsing speed and safety for users, while growing ad revenue share for content creators.\n\nThe web has become a different place. With the ad-tech ecosystem out of control, users have revolted and blocking ads has become the new weapon of choice for improving their browsing speed, safety and privacy. Unfortunately, blocking alone results in a race to the bottom where nobody wins. Without the ability for content creators to earn money for their efforts, users could be left with fewer sites to browse, relegated to hand-picked content from controlled sources.\n\nBrave aims to transform the online ad ecosystem with micropayments and a new revenue-sharing solution to give users and publishers a better deal, where fast, safe browsing is the path to a brighter future for the open web.\n\nTo learn more about Brave web browser which has a built-in AdBlocker, tracking and security protection, and optimized data and battery experience, please go to https://www.brave.com\n\nSupport: If you have any questions or recommendations, please feel free to reach out to us at community.brave.com", "genreIds":["6002", "6007"], "bundleId":"com.brave.ios.browser", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "sellerName":"Brave Software, Inc.", 
"releaseNotes":"Hello all you wonderful people, here’s a little update with some little fixes and a big Shields feature.\n\nHere’s what we updated:\n\n- Cookie Control is back! You can now block all cookies. This was one of the things we had to basically rebuild from scratch when we switched browser engines to WKWebView back in December. So it’s all very new and shiny and modern and new we would appreciate it if you didn’t scratch the paintwork. \n- Bookmarks are easier to use. \n- Everyone hates it when Brave crashes, so we made that happen less. It’s more complicated than it sounds.\n- iPads are supposed to look big and beautiful, but we weren’t looking as beautiful as we wanted. A little UI self-care and we’re pretty as ever.\n- Our translations needed a whole lot of love. Now they only need a lot of love. We’re trying, we promise!\n\nAs ever, thanks for using Brave. If you’ve got any questions or comments, check out https://community.brave.com, or you can reach us directly at http://brave.com/msupport or support+ios@brave.com where we 100% guarantee that an actual human person will definitely read your email.", "minimumOsVersion":"12.0", "averageUserRating":5.0, "userRatingCount":5},

"description":"VPNHUB protects your online privacy and masks your IP. With thousands of servers in over 60 countries, our VPN lets you access sites and streaming from anywhere on the planet, without losing one second of browsing speed. It’s an armored car with a supersonic jet engine.\n\nThe reality today is that the internet is full of restrictions, censorship, privacy invasions, security breaches, and a host of unwanted entities trafficking in your personal data. What a downer!\n\nVPNHUB is your first-class ticket to that original ideal of a truly secure and private internet. It is the most powerful, most reliable and most secure VPN service in existence. Right on!\n\nYou can try VPNHUB right now, without even needing to register! Go ahead and kiss the following problems goodbye, like that time you…\n\n… once bought a tent online and got bombarded with camping equipment ads, or\n… wanted to access news from your home country while abroad but got blocked, or\n… were denied banking assistance because you once visited some online gambling sites, or\n… had your personal data stolen because you used the Wi-Fi at your local café, etc.\n\nVPNHUB is the total solution to all of the above problems and more!\n\nStandard Features:\n* American VPN Servers\n* Military-Grade Encryption\n* Hide Your IP and Location\n* Bypass Censorship\n* Access Public Wi-Fi Securely\n\nVPNHUB Premium includes:\n* Global Video Streaming\n* Servers in 60+ Locations\n* Apps for Desktop \n* Multiple Devices At Once\n* Top Speeds & Zero Data Caps\n\n* Unblock Global Video Streaming\nWatch TV, movies and live sports from any country no matter where you are. VPNHUB spoofs your IP, letting you connect from the VPN server of your choice. Forget angry border guards, VPNHUB is your diplomatic immunity to the world’s most popular sites. \n\n* Bye Bye Censorship\nWith censorship and information control on the rise, the internet can seem like a dark place. VPNHUB transforms the internet into a tool of liberation!\n \n* Avoid Getting Hacked on Public Wi-Fi\nSure it's convenient to get online using the internet at your local coffee shop, but using public Wi-Fi is like living in a glass house with no locks on the doors. Not only are you at risk of having an unwanted audience, but people can stroll right in to steal your personal data, like passwords and photos. VPNHUB encrypts all of your communications over public Wi-Fi.\n\n* Privacy Protection and Location Masking\nYour ISP may keep logs of every website you visit. Other VPNs may do it too. VPNHUB does not, end of story! It’s like wherever you browse, we’re the forensic clean-up crew covering your tracks, and then we wipe our own memories too. And not only your browsing, but we’ll mask your true location by routing your data through our full stack of encrypted global servers.  \n\n* Servers in 60+ Locations\nStandard users get unlimited access to our United States servers. That’s a decent place to start, but why stay put in one spot? Go further. Go global. Go Premium, and get access to servers from over 60 countries in far-flung lands, like from Austria to Australia, from Malaysia to Mexico, or the UK to the UAE, and beyond.\n\nVPNHUB Premium Subscription Details:\n- 7 day free trial offer is commitment free, can be cancelled anytime.\n- Payments charged to user's iTunes Account upon purchase.\n- Subscription lengths and prices: one month ($15.99), one year (89.88).\n- Auto-renewal unless cancelled 24 hours prior to subscription ending.\n- Subscriptions may be managed or cancelled through the user's Account Settings.\n- No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during an active subscription period.\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.appatomic.net/privacy_policy.php\nTerms: https://www.appatomic.net/tos.php", "genreIds":["6007", "6002"], "bundleId":"com.appatomic.vpnhub", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "sellerName":"APPATOMIC LIMITED", "releaseNotes":"Bugs fixing", "minimumOsVersion":"11.0"},

"description":"ProtonVPN’s mission is to make advanced online privacy and security available to everyone. With ProtonVPN, you can:\n- Protect your privacy by hiding your IP address\n- Browse the web securely (even on public WiFi)\n- Visit blocked/censored websites\n\nProtonVPN is a community-supported VPN developed by the same team of scientists that created ProtonMail, the world’s largest encrypted email service. ProtonVPN has a free plan so anybody can use it. You can upgrade to a paid plan to unlock all features.\n\n\nWhy ProtonVPN?\n\n- NO LOGS. EVER\nProtonVPN is a no logs VPN service. We do not track or record your Internet activity, and therefore, cannot disclose this information to third parties.\n\n- STRONG ENCRYPTION\nOur VPN app for iOS uses the IKEv2 protocol. We use only the highest-strength encryption to protect your Internet connection. This means all your network traffic is encrypted with AES-256 and uses 2048-bit RSA key exchange.\n\n- PERFECT FORWARD SECRECY\nProtonVPN uses ciphers with Perfect Forward Secrecy, meaning your encrypted traffic cannot be captured and decrypted later, even if an encryption key gets compromised in the future.\n\n- SWISS BASED\nProtonVPN is a Swiss company, which means you are protected by some of the strongest privacy regulations in the world. \n\n- TRUSTED\nUnlike other VPN services, we provide full transparency so you know who is running the service. Whether it is challenging governments, educating the public, or training journalists, we are well known for fighting for privacy online and contributing to the open source community.\n\n- FREE\nProtonVPN is the ONLY free VPN service that has no privacy invading ads, no malware, no bandwidth limits, and does not secretly sell user data. The free service is supported by optional paid plans that come with more servers and more features.\n\n\nPaid ProtonVPN plans come with additional features, such as:\n\n- HIGH SPEED GLOBAL NETWORK\nProtonVPN has hundreds of servers located all around the world, accessible via a single click. All servers are on high speed 1 Gbit or 10 Gbit connections. Free users can only access slower servers in 3 countries.\n\n- SECURE CORE VPN\nRegular VPN services can be compromised if their servers are under surveillance. ProtonVPN prevents this by first passing user traffic through our Secure Core network in privacy-friendly countries like Switzerland and Iceland. Thus, even a compromised VPN endpoint server will not reveal your true IP address. Secure Core is available for ProtonVPN Plus & ProtonVPN Visionary users.\n\n- TOR VPN\nProtonVPN Plus & ProtonVPN Visionary include Tor support. With a single click, you can route all your traffic through the Tor network and access Onion sites.\n\n\nWhat the world is saying about ProtonVPN\n\n\" It’s worth noting here that ProtonVPN’s free service doesn’t implement data limitations or other caps, as some providers do\" -- VentureBeat\n\n\" ProtonVPN looks to have an admirable goal of bringing an open, private internet to all. \" -- CNET\n\n\" The service, developed by MIT and CERN, promises to route all traffic through privacy-friendly countries ... a great option for those who are looking for a secure VPN option, developed by reputable people.\" --LifeHacker\n\n\nReady to secure your mobile Internet?

"description":"RESEARCHER: TRANSFORMING THE WAY YOU DISCOVER ACADEMIC PAPERS \n\nWe are on a mission to help you become the best scientist you can be. The RESEARCHER team is striving to make it easy and efficient for you to find and read new papers that are vital to your research and teaching. \n\nAN APP DESIGNED BY ACADEMICS, FOR ACADEMICS\nCreate a personalised feed in two minutes. Choose from over 9,000 academic journals covering ten research areas then let RESEARCHER deliver you papers tailored to your interests each day.\n\nRESEARCHER is always up to date. We add thousands of papers each week as soon as they are available from publishers.\n\nRESEARCHER is comprehensive. We have 9,000 academic journals based on impact factor and constantly expand our coverage.\n\nRESEARCHER simplifies the discovery process. We understand the pain points related to keeping on top of an overwhelming amount of published work. That’s why we created filters, notifications and bookmark libraries. \n\nRESEARCHER is constantly growing and evolving. Over 650,000 researchers are part of a burgeoning community representing over 180 countries with more joining each day. Every week we release new content and improvements to our app.\n\nRESEARCHER is free. Create an account that syncs with the web and start browsing papers whenever and wherever you are.\n\n__________________________________________________\n \nFIND AND READ THE LATEST ACADEMIC PAPERS MORE EFFICIENTLY \nChoose your favourite journals from a list of thousands of titles. When new papers are published they will be immediately delivered to the feed you curated. \n\nADD FOCUS TO YOUR CURATED FEED BY APPLYING KEYWORD(S) OR AUTHOR NAMES\nFilter your feed by applying specific keywords or author names to easily find the papers relevant to your research. This saves you from setting up alerts, complicated RSS readers and manually browsing multiple journal websites. \n\nBOOKMARK PAPERS TO READ LATER ANYWHERE\nBookmark papers to read later on mobile or desktop. If you’ve saved dozens of papers, you can quickly find them by searching for the author, journal name or paper title. Prefer to read on your desktop? Go to www.researcher-app.com and your settings will be synced. \n\nBE MORE ORGANISED BY SYNCING PAPERS WITH YOUR REFERENCE MANAGER\nConnect your Mendeley or Zotero account and you can see your bookmarked papers in a folder in the library of your chosen reference manager. (We are adding EndNote, RefWorks and other reference managers soon). \n\nTURN ON NOTIFICATIONS TAILORED TO YOUR CONTENT PREFERENCES\nWant to know when journals critical to your work have published new papers? How about the top paper you shouldn’t miss based on your interests? Simply turn on notifications in the settings. \n\nBROWSE TRENDING PAPERS \nAre you a Chemist that enjoys reading the odd Political Science paper in your spare time? Browsing the trending papers zone allows you to see which publications are getting traction in all 10 research areas and 200+ subjects covered by RESEARCHER.\n\nCONSUME OPEN ACCESS CONTENT WITH EASE\nOur integration with Unpaywall provides you with a simple way to read legally published open access content. Simply look for the open padlock icon on papers and you will have the opportunity to link to the full copy or download the PDF (if available).\n\nSHARE PAPERS WITH YOUR COLLEAGUES \nRegularly receive papers from friends and colleagues via email, Twitter and various other mediums? Streamline your communication with individuals or groups by sharing important content without leaving the app. \n_______________________________________\n\nDisclaimer: RESEARCHER aggregates the abstracts of recently published academic papers.

"description":"Introducing Snowbunny: The NEWEST, FASTEST mobile browser for your iPhone and iPad! Spend more time browsing and less time waiting! Also featuring FULL SCREEN BROWSING and PRIVATE BROWSING functionality! Get this essential web browser for you iPhone and iPad today! + it is COMPLETELY FREE!\n\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n1. SUPER FAST (even faster loading and displaying than Safari*)\n2. FULL SCREEN (beautiful full screen, up to 35% more viewable area^)\n3. PRIVATE MODE (leave no history, cookies, or anything behind)\n4. COMPLETELY FREE (no ad bars, other than what's already on the web)\n\n\nHOW IT WORKS:\n\n\n1. SPEED\nSnowbunny is a highly speed optimised browser using same backend as mobile safari but with code extensively optimized for performance. non-essential features like multi tabs, loading bars have all stripped out to provide an ultra clean, ultra fast, yet fully HTML 5 compliant browser to your mobile device! Our tests show that loading, start up, shutdown, search, and navigation speeds all exceed Safari and other popular browsers by a noticeable margin.\n\n\n2. FULL SCREEN\nWe've consolidated the top and bottom tool bars as seen in Safari into one context sensitive navigation bar saving plenty of space. In addition this toolbar can be hidden simply by browsing down a web page. As well as this, we've removed the annoying status bar at the top of the screen to gain 100% pixel usage when displaying any web page. You can view web pages beautifully using the maximum screen real-estate.\n\n\n3. PRIVATE MODE\nPrivate mode can be enabled via settings. In private browsing mode all history, cookies, login details are completely cleared when you exit or swap between apps. No one will know where you've been!\n\n\nOTHER FEATURES\n- Portrait & Landscape support\n- Scrolling, zooming\n- Bookmarks\n- HTML 5 Web videos, audio streaming\n- Full screen video playback\n- Context sensitive menus\n- iPhone, iPod, iPad, iPhone 4 support\n- Similar UI to Safari.\n- No autosuggest or auto fill in.\n- Tiny download so you can get it quickly.\n\n\nMore Apps:\nhttp://www.savysoda.com\n\n\n* Based on our in-house testing. Not independently verified.\n^ 35% more viewable area on iPhone Landscape Mode. 20%+ in iPhone Portrait Mode.", "genreIds":["6007", "6000"], "bundleId":"com.savysoda.snowRabbit", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "sellerName":"Savy Soda HK Limited", "releaseNotes":"New detailed configurable browsing settings.

"description":"Everything on your iPhone or iPad uses the internet. Your email apps, web browsers, photo apps, banking apps, chat and social apps. \n\nHaving secure internet access is critical and wifi routers are hacked every day. VPN Freely will encrypt your internet traffic preventing WiFi hackers from collecting data mid-stream. It can also help you access sites that may otherwise be blocked.\n\nVPN Freely is the easiest way to secure your iPhone/iPad wifi & cellular internet activity. By simply clicking the \"Secure Me\" button you will be connected to our ultra secure Virtual Private Network. While connected you can safely surf the web, shop online and use banking apps without worry.\n\nStay Connected. Stay Safe.\n\nWhat's so great about VPN Freely?\n\n- Free iOS VPN for iPhone and iPad\n- Stealth Mode **NEW**\n- WiFi Hotspot Security\n- One Click Instant Access to Connect (No Sign-Up Required)\n- No Email, Names or Phone Numbers Required\n- 256 bit Bank Grade VPN Server Encryption\n- No Server Logs or Activity Tracking\n- We never sell user data. None of it. Ever.\n- Your internet traffic will travel over our secure IP similar to a Proxy\n- Encrypt the internet connection to your web browsers and mobile apps\n- No daily limits on usage\n- No data limits on streaming and downloads\n- Built on servers trusted by millions\n- Double the speed of your Free account by subscribing to our Newsletter\n\nAbout our Premium iOS VPN Service Subscriptions:\n\n- Go Premium to remove your speed limits and stop ads\n- Go Premium to remove the 30min session timeout \n- Go Premium to use Stealth Mode\n- Premium subscriptions are tied to your Apple ID. You can use one subscription on up to 5 devices as long as they're using the same Apple ID. After you go Premium simply use the \"Restore Purchase\" option on your additional devices (using the same Apple ID) to make them Premium also.\n- We do offer Free Trials of the Premium version from time to time. These are offered to Free users via popup message in the app.\n- At the end of your trial the auto-renew subscription for Monthly Premium VPN service will start\n- Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n- Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Subscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a Premium subscription\n\nNow for a lesson in security.\n\nWhat is \"WiFi Hotspot Security\" anyway?\n\nWiFi is everywhere now and if we can save our cellular data even just a little bit, we want to connect. However, just because your phone wants to connect to a WiFi hotspot doesn't mean it's safe. The fact is your phone can't tell you if the hotspot is safe or not. \n\nIf the hotspot is not secure other people online may be able to see your internet activity. Hackers love to sniff data on coffee shop WiFi networks because the customers feel comfortable there just like it's home. If the customer is comfortable they'll do things like personal banking online. This is why no public WiFi connection should be trusted.\n\nThe Solution = VPN Freely\n\nIt's so easy! One simple rule...\n\nAfter connecting to a Public WiFi Hotspot. Always, open your iPhone VPN Freely app (or iPad) and click \"Secure Me\". \n\nJust like that your internet access is encrypted and secured. It really is easy to surf the web safely. \n\nDownload VPN Freely today! \n\nDon't forget to try our Premium iOS VPN upgrade for free!\n\nWebsite: http://vpnfreely.com\nPrivacy Policy:  http://vpnfreely.com/privacy\nTerms of Service:  http://vpnfreely.com/terms\n\nNeed help?

OpenVPNプロトコルにのみ対応しているVPNサーバであれば、設定ファイル（.ovpn）を選択してダウンロードし（これは自動で行われることがあります）、OpenVPNを始めとする対応アプリケーションで開けるようになります。\n・アプリケーション起動時に選択する項目の内容は以下のとおりです。\n　　1. メインCSVデータ：「VPN Gate 公開 VPN 中継サーバ」上のCSVデータです。OpenVPNを利用する場合はこちらをお選びください。OpenVPN対応サーバのみの情報（ovpnデータが含まれます）が取得されます。\n　　2. サブCSVデータ：キャッシュサイトです。OpenVPN対応サーバのみの情報（ovpnデータは含まれませんので別途自動ダウンロードします）が取得されます。\n　　3. メインURL：「VPN Gate 公開 VPN 中継サーバ」上のHTMLソースから得たサーバ情報（OpenVPN以外のプロトコルをも含みます）を取得します。\n　　4. サブURL：キャッシュサイトです。OpenVPN以外のプロトコルに対応したサーバを含みます。\n　　5. ミラーサイト：ミラーサイトは選択可能です。ただし取得に時間がかかるかもしれません。\n　　※主にOpenVPNを利用する場合はメインCSVデータを、L2TP/IPsecを利用する場合はメインURLからのデータ取得をおすすめします。\n　　※取得したデータはリクエスト元のIPアドレスや時間でキャッシュ処理をしております。リロードを繰り返すことによって新たなサーバIPが取得できるようにはなっておりません。\n　　※サブCSVあるいはサブURLからのデータ取得を行いVPN接続をした後に別のサーバ情報を試みたい場合は、メインCSVもしくはメインURLからのデータ取得に切り替えてください。\n ・本アプリケーションはURLスキーム　vgv://　で起動可能です。\n\n■ 国旗アイコンは Icon Drawer ( http://icondrawer.com/ ) の Flag Icons をアプリケーション内部に搭載して利用させていただいております。", "genreIds":["6007", "6012"], "bundleId":"co.jp.sensyusya.VPNGateViewer", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "sellerName":"SENSYUSYA Co.,Ltd.",
