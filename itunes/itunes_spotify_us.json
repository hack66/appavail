The Apple Remote would cost a significant amount. Add ANOTHER hit to your wallet for a wireless control like a keyboard, mouse, or the Apple Magic Trackpad!\n\nYou carry your iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad wherever you go… so why should you carry a second device just to control your computer? Furthermore, why should you need line-of-sight to do so?\n\nEnter Rowmote Pro! Rowmote Pro is like your Mac’s remote control, but over the wireless network and even better!

"description":"Explore the world of music with Discovr\n* No. 1 music app in 50+ countries (US, UK, AU and more)\n* Featured by Apple in US, Canada, Australia and more\n* Millions of downloads of Discovr across the globe\n\nDiscovr is an interactive map of the whole world of music. The app makes it easy to discover new music or explore the music you already love by finding similar artists and displaying artist info like biographies, videos, songs, and more.\n\nThe Discovr interface design was called 'Beautiful and dynamic' by The Wall Street Journal, and Discovr has been featured in Billboard Magazine, Wired, BBC, The Guardian, NME, Fox News, AFR, Sydney Morning Herald, The Age, The Australian, and more.\n\n\"If u love music & u have an iPad check out new app Discovr -very cool way to find new music\" — Tony Robbins\n___________________________________\n\nUPDATED DESIGN\nThis version updates the design to support the latest OS design patterns and the full range of iPhone & iPad screen sizes. You'll also see some much requested features like full-size high quality artist images and the new artist detail layouts.\n\nMUSIC\nThe app includes a full music player as well as a mini player you can access anywhere in the app. You can play 30 second sample clips or buy your favorite songs and albums directly the iTunes store. You can also play full length music videos from Youtube. \n\nNEW MUSIC DATA\nThis updated version of the app makes use of new and additional data sources to improve the broad music coverage in the app. The app now covers a lot more artists (around 2 million artists and bands) and includes many newer artists that the old version did not support. From super rare tracks to major hits, you'll find artists, bands, songs, and albums, across thousands of music genres from ultra underground new electronic genres to Norwegian black metal, golden era hip hop, deep indie experiments, pop, country, world, folk, classical, and more.\n\nPERFORMANCE\nThe app has also undergone some big code changes behind the scenes to keep the app up to date with the latest technology changes and security requirements from Apple. The main benefit of these changes is that the app is more efficient and secure, supports bigger music maps, is easier to maintain, and works well across all devices. \n\nSONG MAPS\nIn addition to making maps of similar artists, you can now also make maps of related songs :) You can create a song map by starting with a search for a song instead of an artist, or you can view an artist's profile and then start a map from one of their songs. Note: related songs are determined based on related songs that users also listen to (rather than songs that just sound exactly the same).\n\nFAVORITES\nYou can save your favorite artists for easy access later. Note: favorites that you might have saved in previous versions of the app will not appear in this new version (the new code is a major update and favorites could not be transitioned across).\n\nSHARING\nYou can share maps, songs, and artists straight to Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Email, Messages, and more. Just tap the (...) button on a map, song, or artist to share.\n\nSUPPORT\nThis is a big update, with many changes in design, code, and data sources. If you experience an issue please get in touch so I can fix it for you :) \n\nYou can report an issue at any time by shaking your device. Data fixes (like missing bands or incorrect band info) are usually fixed a few hours after being received from users, so send in your issues :)\n\n___________________________________\n\nDiscovr is a registered trademark in the US, EU, and Australia.

There is no better running music app – Period. Get it now!\n\nRECOMMENDED BY:\n•New York Times\n•Washington Post\n•Health Magazine\n•Runner’s World \n•Men’s Health\n•Women’s Health\n•RealSimple\n•And more!\n\nWHY WE’RE BETTER THAN OTHER APPS\n\n•We're Personalized: PaceDJ lets you use the songs you have saved in your iTunes library.  This means you are in control of your playlists.  Other services provide random playlists created by DJs who don't know your tastes.  \n\n•We're Precise: Some apps claim they can serve songs at BPMs to pace you to a specific minute/mile time.  Unless they know your stride length, they can't do this accurately.   PaceDJ helps you find the right BPM first, and then fine tune to match your mile time goal.  \n\n•We're Free! Try PaceDJ for free to see how you like it!  Then upgrade to Premium for features including intervals training, dislike button, and remove ads.  \n\n•We're Unique: PaceDJ is the ONLY APP that speeds up or slows down BPMs to match your running pace AND allows you to create interval workouts.   \n\n•Like Intervals?  We've got that! Create custom interval workouts or choose from pre-programmed templates.\n\n•Each song you own can pace you at multiple levels – a massive increase in the usefulness of your music library\n\n•PaceDJ.com provides a FREE music discovery service so you can find and purchase songs that match your running pace.\n\n•Echonest song database has over 35million songs and 2.8 million artists.\n\n•Easily correct BPMs by tapping on the drum. \n\nUSER REVIEWS: \n•\"I love this app, I use it to crank up speed work for marathon training without my pace conflicting with my music!\"\n\n•\"PaceDJ allowed me to find tunes that helped me pace myself… and spend my energy focusing on…proper running form. I use PaceDJ on every run.\"\n\n•\"PaceDJ gives me that extra boost of motivation. It gives me the proper speeds I need to stay on pace and even ramp up my speed work.\"\n\nON THE WEB AT WWW.PACEDJ.COM\n\nTECHNICAL INFORMATION\nv2.0 requires iOS9.0 and higher.\n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background in PaceDJ can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE:\ncustomerservice@pacedj.com\n\n\nTHIS APP AND ANY INFORMATION GIVEN BY IT ARE NOT INTENDED NOR IMPLIED TO BE A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL ADVICE.

"description":"We believe music is better with friends! JQBX lets you be a DJ, join a party, or just kick back and listen to music with friends or strangers from all over the world in real time. JQBX hooks into your Spotify account and is 100% free to use. Give it a try and start listening. Together. (Requires a Spotify Premium Account)\n\n\nHow It Works\n\n\nRoom: The place where music gets shared\nYou can create a room or join one that already exists. Rooms can be public or private and you get to decide how many DJ's can take turns playing music. You can also pick the genre and invite friends to join. Once you're in a room you can chat, DJ, listen or just kick back and enjoy the vibe.\n\n\nDJ: The tastemakers\nIf you want to share a song, just click 'be a DJ' and you will be added to the list of DJ's in the room. When it's your turn the song at the top of your queue will play for everyone in the room. If someone votes or stars your track, it will show up on your notifications.\n\n\nChat: Share your thoughts\nEach room has a dedicated chat box where you can share your thoughts about music, life, or anything else. You can single out a single person in the room by pressing the '@' button and picking them from the list. You can also embed images and all sorts of other fun stuff to make your voice heard!\n\n\nDiscover New Music\nDigging a song? Just star it and it will be saved to your starred playlist. Digging someone's vibe? You can follow them and get notified whenever they are spinning on JQBX. Loving the tracks in a room? You can export the entire track history to a playlist to relive the magic at your next party.\n\n\nCustomize Your Profile\nYou can upload unique gifs and change your username in real time to suit your mood! You can have four distinct images to reflect how you feel about a certain song that's being played.\n\n\nKeep Your Hits Organized\nAll the music you save, add to your queue, and export gets instantly added to your Spotify profile. All your music stays in the same place and can be retrieved on any Spotify enabled device.", "bundleId":"com.thebestagency.jqbx", "trackId":1189991978, "trackName":"JQBX: Discover Music Together", "genreIds":["6011", "6016"], "releaseDate":"2017-01-05T19:00:40Z", "primaryGenreName":"Music", "primaryGenreId":6011, "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2018-09-04T21:00:40Z", "sellerName":"Jason Zigelbaum", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "averageUserRating":4.5, "userRatingCount":85},
