"description":"\"Hook is exactly what the doctor ordered. Many apps came close but you nailed it.\" —DJ puzzle\n\n\"Hook is definitely the most fun I've had making music on iOS.  The sampling options are vast and the editing is intuitive.  It's connectivity and versatility makes it a powerful performance tool and production sketchbook.\" — Starkey\n\n5 STARS \"Most impressive DJ mashup & sampler / editor I've seen on iOS so far! It's like the best of all other apps combined in one and all of the latest developments integrated like recording or importing ur own music and inter-app audio.\" — App Store Review\n\n====\nThis is the free iPhone version of Hook. There's also an iPad version for 13 bucks. The feature sets are identical, but the iPad version is optimized for the larger screen, including iPad Pro. The iPad version also comes with 4 additional sound packs with over 500 samples.\n====\n\nHook is a new music performance, mashup, and DJ app for iPhone and iPad. Arrange and trigger loops on a grid and create dynamic, expressive transitions with the Flux Fader — a multitouch \"smart crossfader\" that allows you to expressively make transitions between any combination of tracks/cells on the fly. The Flux Fader includes a two-axis control with 9 riser synths, glitch and gate effects, tempo-synced filter sweeps, an EQ, beat drop, tape stop, and filter drop. Combining all these to make transitions is the heart of playing live with Hook. Hook includes a full editor complete with auto transient slicing and waveform editing. Tight integration with AudioCopy makes it easy to drop in your own loops and sounds from other apps.\n\nReal creative power can be found in the integrated sampler — record from mic/line, other apps via inter-app audio, and grab hooks from iTunes and Spotify. Change tempo in real time, and keep all your hooks in sync. Hook is a killer mashup tool with a full mixer, tons of tracks, integrated FX bus, per-cell fx, transpose, time stretching, tuning, timing and trigger settings, and more. Imagine the clip launching capabilities of Ableton Live in a futuristic multitouch environment.\n\n====\nExtend Hook with Wej!\nWej is an iOS music hub that combines a non-skid performance base with integrated lightshow and wireless MIDI for up to two controllers — all while keeping your iOS device charged.

"description":"Run longer, faster, and stronger with PaceDJ, the only app that modifies music BPMs to match your running pace AND allows you to create interval workouts.  There is no better running music app – Period. Get it now!\n\nRECOMMENDED BY:\n•New York Times\n•Washington Post\n•Health Magazine\n•Runner’s World \n•Men’s Health\n•Women’s Health\n•RealSimple\n•And more!\n\nWHY WE’RE BETTER THAN OTHER APPS\n\n•We're Personalized: PaceDJ lets you use the songs you have saved in your iTunes library.  This means you are in control of your playlists.  Other services provide random playlists created by DJs who don't know your tastes.  \n\n•We're Precise: Some apps claim they can serve songs at BPMs to pace you to a specific minute/mile time.  Unless they know your stride length, they can't do this accurately.   PaceDJ helps you find the right BPM first, and then fine tune to match your mile time goal.  \n\n•We're Free! Try PaceDJ for free to see how you like it!  Then upgrade to Premium for features including intervals training, dislike button, and remove ads.  \n\n•We're Unique: PaceDJ is the ONLY APP that speeds up or slows down BPMs to match your running pace AND allows you to create interval workouts.   \n\n•Like Intervals?  We've got that! Create custom interval workouts or choose from pre-programmed templates.\n\n•Each song you own can pace you at multiple levels – a massive increase in the usefulness of your music library\n\n•PaceDJ.com provides a FREE music discovery service so you can find and purchase songs that match your running pace.\n\n•Echonest song database has over 35million songs and 2.8 million artists.\n\n•Easily correct BPMs by tapping on the drum. \n\nUSER REVIEWS: \n•\"I love this app, I use it to crank up speed work for marathon training without my pace conflicting with my music!\"\n\n•\"PaceDJ allowed me to find tunes that helped me pace myself… and spend my energy focusing on…proper running form.

"description":"Audiofy is the simple yet powerful integrated multiroom professional audio system created by ThinKnx. Only one device combines audio matrix routing, power amplifiers for each output and up to four independent network players. It is also fully configurable via web.\nThe system permits to spread audio contents from external analog sources or from internal players towards up to 16 rooms with superior pure sound quality.\nThanks to the many protocols supported, it is perfectly integrated inside automation systems. A native KNX TP port allows to send commands to the music system directly from other KNX devices and to receive feedbacks.\nThrough this app, the final user decides the routing of the audio sources and has a complete control over his music listening experience.

"description":"This game's for kids is an application for pre-school & kindergarten kids who are in early stage of identifying and learning to write English alphabets. This application helps children to memorize and learn to write in three stages:   \nObserve and memorize: In this step, kids learn letter writing flow and directions with pleasing animations.  \nObserve and trace : In this step, kids learn to write letters by tracing a guiding animation on letters.  \n  \nABC Fruits is more than just a kid-friendly educational app, it was designed with adult participation in mind, too. The interface keeps toddlers focused on alphabet reading and writing, tucking menu commands away from moving fingers. Adults can easily access settings to engage Teacher Mode, look at report cards, or toggle tracing and phonics games to better facilitate learning. \n  \nFEATURES \n•\tShow and enforce how to write letters correctly \n•\tLearn to write uppercase alphabet letters\n•\tShapes tracing activity for toddlers \n•\tBright, colorful graphics\n•\tBeautiful cartoon animation of animals", "bundleId":"com.jansee.abcgame.fruit5", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "genreIds":["6014", "7009", "6017"], "releaseDate":"2016-12-21T17:36:42Z", "primaryGenreName":"Games", "primaryGenreId":6014},

"description":"We believe music is better with friends! JQBX lets you be a DJ, join a party, or just kick back and listen to music with friends or strangers from all over the world in real time. JQBX hooks into your Spotify account and is 100% free to use. Give it a try and start listening. Together. (Requires a Spotify Premium Account)\n\n\nHow It Works\n\n\nRoom: The place where music gets shared\nYou can create a room or join one that already exists. Rooms can be public or private and you get to decide how many DJ's can take turns playing music. You can also pick the genre and invite friends to join. Once you're in a room you can chat, DJ, listen or just kick back and enjoy the vibe.\n\n\nDJ: The tastemakers\nIf you want to share a song, just click 'be a DJ' and you will be added to the list of DJ's in the room. When it's your turn the song at the top of your queue will play for everyone in the room. If someone votes or stars your track, it will show up on your notifications.\n\n\nChat: Share your thoughts\nEach room has a dedicated chat box where you can share your thoughts about music, life, or anything else. You can single out a single person in the room by pressing the '@' button and picking them from the list. You can also embed images and all sorts of other fun stuff to make your voice heard!\n\n\nDiscover New Music\nDigging a song? Just star it and it will be saved to your starred playlist. Digging someone's vibe? You can follow them and get notified whenever they are spinning on JQBX. Loving the tracks in a room? You can export the entire track history to a playlist to relive the magic at your next party.\n\n\nCustomize Your Profile\nYou can upload unique gifs and change your username in real time to suit your mood! You can have four distinct images to reflect how you feel about a certain song that's being played.\n\n\nKeep Your Hits Organized\nAll the music you save, add to your queue, and export gets instantly added to your Spotify profile. All your music stays in the same place and can be retrieved on any Spotify enabled device.", "bundleId":"com.thebestagency.jqbx", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "genreIds":["6011", "6016"], "releaseDate":"2017-01-05T19:00:40Z", "primaryGenreName":"Music", "primaryGenreId":6011},
