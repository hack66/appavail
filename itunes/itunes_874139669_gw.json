"description":"Privacy is possible. Signal makes it easy.\n\nUsing Signal, you can communicate instantly while avoiding SMS fees, create groups so that you can chat in real-time with all of your friends at once, and share media and other files with complete privacy. The server never has access to any of your communication and never stores any of your data.\n\n• Say Anything - Signal uses an advanced end-to-end encryption protocol that provides privacy for every message every time.\n\n• Open Source - Signal is Free and Open Source, enabling anyone to verify its security by auditing the code. Signal is the only private messenger that uses open source and peer-reviewed cryptographic protocols to keep your messages safe.\n\n• Be Yourself - Signal uses your existing phone number and address book. There are no separate logins, usernames, passwords, or PINs to manage or lose.\n\n• Group Chat - Signal allows you to create encrypted groups so that you can have private conversations with all of your friends at once. Not only are the messages encrypted, but the Signal server never has access to any group information like the membership list, group title, or group icon.\n\n• Fast - The Signal protocol is designed to operate in the most constrained environment possible. Messages are delivered quickly and reliably.\n\n• Speak Freely - Make crystal-clear voice and video calls to people who live across town, or across the ocean, with no long-distance charges.\n\nFor support, questions, or more information, please visit:\nhttp://support.signal.org\n\nSource code:\nhttps://github.com/signalapp/Signal-iOS\n\nFollow us on Twitter (@signalapp) for all of the latest updates and announcements.", "bundleId":"org.whispersystems.signal", "trackName":"Signal - Private Messenger", "releaseDate":"2014-07-29T18:24:15Z", "primaryGenreName":"Social Networking", "primaryGenreId":6005, "genreIds":["6005", "6002"]}]
