Moreover your connection is encrypted.\n- ISPs and insecure wireless networks won't see your browsing. It will be difficult for anybody to trace your internet activities back to your device.\n- You will be able to access .onion websites which are only accessible through the TOR network.\n- Advanced browsing capability with tabs, and popover detection and blocking.\n- You can automatically delete cookies, cache and third party data on application exit.\n- Support for audio and video playback.\n- Easy to use interface: just one button to connect to the closest server!\n\nIf you purchase our Premium subscription you will also be able to enjoy the following advanced features:\n- Ads-Free experience.\n- Unlimited VPN Session duration.\n- Priority Support.\n \nVPN + TOR is the allay for data safety you can trust. Download it now and secure your mobile browser: it's fast and easy, you just need to tap a button to enjoy full anonymity. Be untraceable wherever you are, choose unlimited privacy and security!\n\n-------------------\nSUBSCRIPTION INFO:\n\nSubscribe to take advantage of all the features described above.\n• Subscription length: weekly, monthly, yearly\n• Your payment will be charged to your iTunes Account as soon as you confirm your purchase.\n• You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal from your Account Settings after the purchase.\n• Your subscription will renew automatically, unless you turn off auto-renew at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n• The cost of renewal will be charged to your account in the 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n• When canceling a subscription, your subscription will stay active until the end of the period.

Other features include, but are not limited to:\n\n- Use VOIP service from anywhere\n- Accelerate online games: get extremely low latency when playing Order & Chaos, MetalStorm online and etc.\n- Assigns your computer a new IP address, hides your real IP to anonymize all web applications.\n- A secure encrypted connection between your computer and the Internet.\n- Secure your wireless (Wi-Fi) connection at home or at public Hotspots.\n- Unlike a proxy, you get secured connection for all programs you are using, (e.g ICQ, Email, FTP, News and anything that uses a Internet Connection)\n\nWHY USE VPN EXPRESS FOR YOUR VPN SERVICES?\n- Support All VPN Protocols available in iOS devices: IPSec, L2TP over IPSec and PPTP!\n- Lowest Rates with 24x7 availability! 99% service up time!

VPN Express does exactly what, when, & how I need it for a very reasonable price. Best one out there!\"\n\n+++++ Jan 22, 2012 by Neil.D\n\"100% Perfect. 100% of the Time - This is the best VPN solution I have used. It's on my Mac, iPad and iPhone and can be used simultaneously! The pricing plans are awesome as well. Saves me a bundle.\"\n\n+++++ Jan 11, 2012 by Anthony Martinez\n\"Simple, efficient VPN. It just works. - Very easy to use with auto-configure setting. I use this all the time, and find it is great when traveling internationally or when I want greater wifi security in coffee shops. Recommended.\"\n\n+++++ Oct 17, 2011 by Computer Bear\n\"VPN Express - This app is great. Skype was blocked at the hospital where my son was in the NICU. My family and friends could not always travel the 150 mile round trip with us to see the baby. The hospitals IT director was asked to unblock Skype several times. He would not. With this app I went around the firewall. I highly recommend this app.\"", "artistId":367346409, "artistName":"Express Network Solutions Limited", "genres":["Productivity", "Utilities"], "price":0.00, "bundleId":"com.bestsparks.vpnclient", "trackName":"VPN Express - Free Mobile VPN", "genreIds":["6007", "6002"]},

A Proxy server is, however, completely browser-based, and might not be compatible with certain web pages that use non-browser technology. Unlike a Proxy, a VPN service encrypts all your traffic and will work with all internet based services. In summary, VPN will provide you with more online privacy and security.\n\nWith Touch VPN you can：\n\n* When you’re connected to a public Wi-Fi Hotspot, your name, passwords, and personal information can be easily compromised.

The button connects you to one of many servers at speeds faster than a web proxy. When you are not running our app we help you save your device's battery.\n\n* Surf the Web Privately.  Your real IP address is concealed and your internet activity is inaccessible to prying eyes and businesses.\n\n--------------\n\nSubscription:\n\nYou can be an Elite user through auto-renewable subscription.

"description":"Everything on your iPhone or iPad uses the internet. Your email apps, web browsers, photo apps, banking apps, chat and social apps. \n\nHaving secure internet access is critical and wifi routers are hacked every day. VPN Freely will encrypt your internet traffic preventing WiFi hackers from collecting data mid-stream. It can also help you access sites that may otherwise be blocked.\n\nVPN Freely is the easiest way to secure your iPhone/iPad wifi & cellular internet activity. By simply clicking the \"Secure Me\" button you will be connected to our ultra secure Virtual Private Network. While connected you can safely surf the web, shop online and use banking apps without worry.\n\nStay Connected. Stay Safe.\n\nWhat's so great about VPN Freely?\n\n- Free iOS VPN for iPhone and iPad\n- Stealth Mode **NEW**\n- WiFi Hotspot Security\n- One Click Instant Access to Connect (No Sign-Up Required)\n- No Email, Names or Phone Numbers Required\n- 256 bit Bank Grade VPN Server Encryption\n- No Server Logs or Activity Tracking\n- We never sell user data. None of it.

However, just because your phone wants to connect to a WiFi hotspot doesn't mean it's safe. The fact is your phone can't tell you if the hotspot is safe or not. \n\nIf the hotspot is not secure other people online may be able to see your internet activity. Hackers love to sniff data on coffee shop WiFi networks because the customers feel comfortable there just like it's home. If the customer is comfortable they'll do things like personal banking online. This is why no public WiFi connection should be trusted.\n\nThe Solution = VPN Freely\n\nIt's so easy! One simple rule...\n\nAfter connecting to a Public WiFi Hotspot. Always, open your iPhone VPN Freely app (or iPad) and click \"Secure Me\". \n\nJust like that your internet access is encrypted and secured. It really is easy to surf the web safely. \n\nDownload VPN Freely today! \n\nDon't forget to try our Premium iOS VPN upgrade for free!\n\nWebsite: http://vpnfreely.com\nPrivacy Policy:  http://vpnfreely.com/privacy\nTerms of Service:  http://vpnfreely.com/terms\n\nNeed help?

Change your virtual location for extra privacy. \n\n• VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK: With a VPN, your actual IP address is hidden from the services you visit.

We do not log your traffic. \n\n• WI-FI SECURITY: Even on unsecured public Wi Fi, your traffic is encrypted and impossible to intercept. \n\n• SURF SAFE AND UNTRACKED: FREEDOME blocks unwanted third-party tracking and malicious sites. This will also stop advertisers from making money at the expense of your privacy.\n\n• NO LIMITS: Unlimited bandwidth. No traffic logs. \n\nHighly rated by magazines\n\nWired: “The good news is that CSIRO researchers did find some gems. They specifically lauded F-Secure Freedome, an app that encrypts what it says it will.” - February 8th 2017\n\nArsTechnica: “Those relying on an app that isn't Freedome should consider dumping it or at least suspending use of it until they have reviewed the app's performance.” – January 28th 2017\n\nPCWorld: “Freedome VPN pledges not to log your traffic and is run by F-Secure, an established and reputable name in Internet security.” – March 29th 2017\n\n\n\nSUBSCRIPTION OPTIONS \n\nF-Secure FREEDOME VPN is free to download and use for 5 days. It’s quick to install – no registrations or settings required.\n\nOne subscription covers all your iOS devices with the same Apple ID.\n\nFREEDOME is also available as part of F-Secure TOTAL.\n\nNOTE: Your subscription automatically renews unless the subscription is canceled at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. The payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at the purchase confirmation. Your iTunes account will be automatically charged at the same price for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period unless you cancel your subscription at ‘Manage subscriptions’ under ‘Settings’. No cancellation of the current subscription is possible during active subscription period. Any unused portion of a free trial period, will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription. \n\n\nWE LOVE TO HEAR FROM OUR USERS\n\nF-Secure FREEDOME is ready to use, but it doesn't mean we're done improving it on it.

"description":"• #1 ad blocking solution for iOS\n• Over 750 000 app downloads worldwide\n• No in-app purchases, no subscription. Simple one-time payment\n• Top Utility ranked in all App Stores around the world \n• Over 1000+ carefully crafted filters\n• Easy setup in under 1 minute with detailed tutorial\n• Now with built-in Safari Content Blocker for better web ad protection\n\nWeblock allows you to control how your device fetches online content. Easily manage PAC (Proxy Auto-Config) script and route different connections through different proxy servers. Weblock can make your device download ads (banners and popups), stats and user tracking, scripts or images through a proxy server you pick. It also allows you to use a different proxy for specific websites, like Facebook, Twitter, Google+, social widgets from websites. You can even define your own content filters. With Weblock you can control proxy for basically any network resource! This way you can choose not to reveal your real IP to different services, limit advanced ad targeting and protect your privacy.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICE: You're responsible for selecting a proxy server that allows you to download content you wish to download. We DO NOT provide a proxy service. Using a bad proxy server (like 127.0.0.1:8021) might result in some resources being blocked. You can control your proxy settings selectively with Weblock. Contact our support if you need help choosing right proxy server or setting up Weblock on your device.\n\nHere are some situations in which Weblock might come in handy:\n• Fetch ads through a proxy server you choose. Protect your privacy and prevent ad servers from knowing your real IP address and tracking you.\n• Disable majority of ads on websites you visit on your iOS device! Weblock supports all major web browsers: Safari, Chrome, Mercury and others (browsers redirecting web traffic through third-party servers like Puffin Browser or Opera Mini are not be supported).\n• Easily remove all native Facebook widgets and plugins (Like buttons, comments, etc.) on sites you visit - simply disable Facebook plugins in Weblock! Do the same for Twitter, Google+ and other social media.\n• Stop annoying Tapatalk popups, nagging you to download forum browsing app on every visit.\n• Take control of someone else's device - you can preconfigure any iOS device to control it with your Weblock app. Block or redirect any content, anytime, directly from your own device.\n• Your predefined filters and custom rules can be synced between all your iOS devices using iCloud.\n• If you wish to block something else, you can create your own rules and filters. You can block any URL (with regular expressions), domain or IP address. Don't know how? Let us know - we're here for you.\n• You can also use Weblock's redirect feature to emulate '/etc/hosts' entries for HTTP and HTTPS traffic. This might be useful for web and app developers to pin domains to different IP addresses.\n\n••• IMPORTANT! •••\nNeed help setting up Weblock?

"description":"Private Internet Access VPN\n\nProtect your privacy with Private Internet Access®, the world's leading VPN service for iOS users on iPhone and iPad. Private Internet Access®, or PIA, enables users to encrypt their network traffic and stay protected when online with our proxy servers. Add privacy and security to private and public networks when you browse the Internet and use WiFi, whether connected to a hotspot or at home. High speeds, unlimited bandwidth, connect with 5 devices simultaneously (smartphones, tablets, computers), no traffic logs, and 24/7 professional, native English speaking customer support.\n\nWHY USE VPN FROM PRIVATE INTERNET ACCESS®?\n\n• Low price. $3.33 per month if you purchase a yearly account ($39.99/year) or $6.99 on a monthly basis.\n• Reliable and trusted VPN provider since 2010 with a proven no log policy.\n• Privacy is our Policy. Here at PIA, we not only provide a great VPN service at a low price, but we also support organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, FightForTheFuture, Creative Commons, Open Rights Group, Index on Censorship, freenode, Wireguard, Arch Linux, and many others.\n\nWe respect your privacy and anonymity.\n\nBY USING VPN FROM PRIVATE INTERNET ACCESS®, YOU GET:\n\n• IP Cloaking. Your IP address will be changed to a Private Internet Access IP address to hide your identity and location. Hide your IP address to stop data trackers, snoopers, and hackers from tracking your browsing and search activity.\n\n• Data Encryption. Encrypt your internet traffic with our VPN proxy. Our trusted online privacy service creates several security layers which keep you anonymous and prevent access to your data. It’s time to change your WiFi habits. Don’t use WiFi without our secure VPN to proxy your internet traffic!\nWiFi Security. With WPA and WPA2 now kracked, you need a VPN to protect your WiFi everywhere - not just in hotspots, coffee shops, cafes, hotels, and airports. If you use WiFi hotspots without encryption, your data can be seen, blocked, throttled, censored, or otherwise changed.\n\n• Content Blocker. The Safari Content Blocker blocks ads, trackers, and malware while browsing with Safari.\n\nWHAT DO OUR CUSTOMERS THINK?\n\n“Firstly, the company is second to none in terms of support, troubleshooting, and individualized assistance. Their nodes and hubs are top speed. Their client is streamlined and has a tremendous ease of use.”\nJAYDLUV, 10/10/2017\n\n“This is my go to app for VPN. Been using Windows version for years and the iPad version is great.”\nPkcarreon, 09/18/2017\n\n“No hiccups, no crashes or anything. It just works great. Bear in mind you have to subscribe to the service for this to work. I highly recommend it.”\nScott Loflin, 09/15/2017\n\n“Simple and solid. No issues even when traveling.”\nJoe1134206, 09/8/2017\n\n“Love it. Feel safer when browsing the internet.”\nCachuco, 08/7/2017\n\n“Hard to find a nit with this app. (...) The iOS app allows a quicker toggle on/off than digging into settings, for VPN hostile iOS apps like Pandora and Netflix. I like PIA’s value for the money, and I have not had any trouble whatsoever with the iOS app. I recommend this app, and PIA, as one of your layers of online security.”\nDB Associates, 01/27/2017\n\n“I did my homework, reviewing many VPN services. PIA was among the most economical, plenty of simultaneous connections and more than enough servers and services. (...) The speed is more than I hoped for. I can stream all YouTube videos. HD quality is superb with no buffering. I am happy to have this extra security on all our devices. My wife could not tell the difference after I installed it on her PC. I think I paid $39.99/year. What a bargain!”\nHelmut, 06/20/2016\n\nGDPR compatibility\n\nThis application only sends username and encrypted passwords to our servers as part of using this app. During signups, we also collect user's email. We do not collect and/or store any other user information.", "artistId":445501786, "artistName":"London Trust Media, Inc.", "genres":["Productivity", "Utilities"], "price":0.00, "bundleId":"com.privateinternetaccess.ios.PIA-VPN", "trackName":"VPN by Private Internet Access", "genreIds":["6007", "6002"]},

(Free VPN version may show some ads. Upgrade to Hi VPN Premium to enjoy ad-free VPN, if you prefer.)\n\nWhat is a VPN and Why Would I Need One?\n\nA VPN, or Virtual Private Network, allows you to create a secure connection to another network over the Internet. VPNs can be used to shield your browsing activity from prying eyes on public Wi-Fi, and more.\n\nIn very simple terms, a VPN connects your PC, smartphone, or tablet to another computer (called a server) somewhere on the internet, and allows you to browse the internet using that computer’s internet connection. So if that server is in a different country, it will appear as if you are coming from that country, and you can potentially access things that you couldn’t normally.\n\nThe vast majority of people these days are using VPN. They are still very useful for protecting yourself while working at a coffee shop, but that’s hardly the primary use anymore.\n\nHi VPN Premium service includes:\n\n• 3-day free trial: free of charge; no commitment; cancel anytime.\n• Price of subscription: one-year plan: $3.99/mo; 6-month plan: $5.33/mo; monthly plan: $7.99/mo.\n• Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n• Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n• Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal.\n• Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.\n• Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nTerms of Use: http://bit.ly/HiVPNTerms\nPrivacy Policy: http://bit.ly/HiVPNPrivacy\n\nCopyright © 2019 Hi Security Lab.

"description":"Nowadays, Privacy is a Luxury!\nWhenever we pay our bills, manage our bank accounts, or log in to our favorite social networks, our credentials, account numbers, billing address, and other private data may end up in the crosshairs of identity thieves.\nTrust your security and privacy to professionals!\n\nWEB PRIVACY\nKeep your internet activities anonymous and untraceable wherever you are. Zero-log policy, traffic encryption, IP and DNS masking. These all mean that third parties are not able to monitor you any longer, and that your privacy is reliably secured from obtrusive website and ISP surveillance.\n\n+70 LOCATIONS\nOur high-speed VPN servers in 70+ locations all over the globe, as well as our enhanced KeepSolid Wise technology, allow you to freely surf the web without giving out a single piece of your personal information, including your current location. Don’t let websites discriminate you based on the way you surf the internet or the place you browse it from.\n\nTOTAL SECURITY\nWe offers a variety of VPN protocols, each with unique capabilities and strengths. Just choose the one you would like to try. For instance:\nOpenVPN - an extremely secure and highly configurable protocol that uses a wide range of encryption algorithms (including AES-256).\nIKEv2 - a secure and easy-to-setup protocol that can effectively change networks and re-establish VPN connection if it was temporarily lost. It provides a significantly higher connection speed and a better performance.\n\nWe offer three recurring subscription options: \n- 1 Month, 3 months, 1 Year\n- Subscriptions will auto-renew unless canceled.\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.\n- No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period.\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n- Your account will be charged for renewal for the amount of your current subscription within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period. All costs for subscriptions are mentioned above.\n\nPrivacy policies : https://luni.app/support/vpn_privacy\nTerms of use : https://luni.app/support/vpn_terms\n\nDisclaimer: We have had reports that our VPN service might be blocked in the countries listed below:\n- China\n- UAE\n- Saudi Arabia\n- Iraq\n- Iran\n- Turkmenistan\n- Turkey\n\nWhile we can’t say that it’s totally impossible to connect in the mentioned locations, there are a few challenges to overcome.", "artistId":1274051421, "artistName":"Luni", "genres":["Productivity", "Business"], "price":0.00, "bundleId":"vpnfree.app", "trackName":"VPN ·", "genreIds":["6007", "6000"]},

"description":"Proxy connects you to your friends nearby. Whether you’re traveling on the other side of the world, hanging on the other side of town, or chilling at home, Proxy shows you who of your friends are nearby right now. Share what you are doing and see what friends are up to with status messages. Start a conversation on Proxy and meet up in person.\n\nProxy shares your proximity with friends nearby, not your exact location, so friends will only see that you’re “<1 mi” or “5 mi” away, not that you’re at Magic: The Gathering store (unless you say so in your status). \n\nProxy currently uses Facebook to connect you to your nearby friends. It will provide alternative onboarding methods such as phone contacts in the future, but Proxy currently requires Facebook.\n\n*** We have shutdown the Proxy server to focus on other projects (see Whammy in the App Store). Thanks to those of you that used Play. If you really want Play to come back, send us a message at info@joinproxy.com ***\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Proximity: Proxy doesn’t share your exact location with anyone, only your proximity (e.g. 5 miles) with friends who are nearby.\n\n* Status: Share what you are doing with friends nearby and see what they’re up to with status messages.\n\n* Messaging: Quickly connect with friends nearby via text messages.\n\n* Context: Status messages and conversations are in the moment and will clear as your context (location and time) changes.\n\n* Ghost Mode and blocking: Easily block individual users or switch into Ghost Mode to temporarily stop sharing your proximity with all users.\n\n* Privacy: Proxy doesn’t store your past locations, statuses, or conversations. \n\n* Low energy footprint: Proxy doesn't constantly update your location in the background so it will not negatively affect your battery charge.\n\n\nWhy use Proxy:\n\n* “In the present”: While most social apps remove you from your present situations, Proxy is entirely focused on here and now. “Spend less time looking at your friends’ photos and more time in them.”\n\n* “In the know”: While most social apps keep you in the know about news or cute animal videos that your friends like, Proxy keeps you in the know about what your friends are up to right now in your proximity.\n\n* “In the proxy”: Proxy turns your immediate proximity into a constant party.

It will run in the background and will not fall asleep while at least one tunnel is connected\n- Supports local and dynamic port forwarding (aka socks5 proxy)\n- Password or Private Key authentication\n- Host Key Fingerprint checking\n- Connection data transfer statistics\n- Connection Export & Import\n- Passcode & Face ID protection\n- Provides a local URL for a Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) file\n- Disconnect notification\n- Idle disconnect timer\n- Advanced logging for a debug purpose\n\nYou need to have an SSH server configured to use this application.\n\nThe advantage of the SSH Tunnel is the ability to fully control traffic redirection. The application allows manual configuration of the PAC (Proxy Auto-Config) file using special rules. For example, redirection depending on the Wi-Fi network to which the phone is connected (home/work), time of day or the address of the requested resource itself.\n\nSSH Tunnel support email: support@mobibean.zendesk.com", "artistId":1142567045, "artistName":"Yury Bushev", "genres":["Utilities"], "price":8.99, "bundleId":"bushev.ssh.tunnel", "trackName":"SSH Tunnel - with socks5 proxy", "genreIds":["6002"]},

However, there still comes a tiny flaw: HTTP proxy can't be used under 4G.\nAnother concern of this app is the PAC (proxy auto-config) files. In most situation, one PAC file will be enough, but when you need multiple PAC files from multiple different resources, the user may have to learn how to merge them, make the situation even worse.\nSo here comes the solution: Filter proxy! It allows you to use HTTP proxy under 4G, make it a quite handy tool for iOS developers, especially when developers are trying to debug behavior specific to 4G. It also allows you to use multiple PAC files as rules, only the rule matched first get the chance to decide which proxy to go.\nBest of all, this app will capture absolute zero data from you - and you can verify that by download source code from https://github.com/cnnblike/discord.
