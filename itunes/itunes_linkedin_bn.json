Eight users can share news & updates with their Eight network or even interact with each other through instant messages. \n\nWhy Eight?\n-\tIt scans business cards with 99.9% accuracy using both OCR & human transcription thus helping users to manage contacts and stay linked in conveniently and easily.\n-\tThe standard version is free and includes scanning, organizing features. \n-\tUsers can purchase Eight Premium for quicker digitization and more benefits.\n-\tUsers can sync their networks to their devices. Data is also automatically updated if connected contacts change the details on their business card.\n\nWhat Eight has in store for you:\n\n- Organize business cards & professional networks: \nUsers often have a large stack of disorganized visiting cards & biz cards making them difficult to use and refer to. Eight is a free digital card holder that solves this problem by removing the need for manual entry. Now using your mobile cam, cards will be instantly digitized into an e visiting card, and you will be able to see full information of the card on the app. Additionally, once digitized, Eight lets users add notes & tags on profiles so they can manage contacts & organize their business & professional network efficiently. It's a digital card scanner, holder, reader & organizer consolidated in a single app.\n\n- Manual input to ensure superior accuracy: \nEight uses a combination of OCR technology & human resources to digitize business cards from a scanned image into a digital Eight profile. After users scan their biz cards, Eight uses OCR technology to instantly read the data on the visiting cards, which is then manually checked & corrected by our team, ensuring 99.9% accuracy even for the most hard-to-read cards. It's a perfect digital card maker as it easily converts visiting cards to e biz cards.\n\n- Easy search feature to find & reach contacts from within the app: \nThis is not your regular visiting cards scanner or digital business card holder. It allows users to manage contacts & contact them via email or phone, helping them unlock new business & career opportunities. It is especially helpful for salespeople and salesforce users to manage & convert leads.\n\n- Free to use basic app with an option to buy premium features: \nThe standard version of the app is free to use and has all the essential functions that make Eight a powerful business solution. Users can purchase Eight Premium for additional benefits including an ability to export their data (e.g. phonebook sync). It not only helps users to convert their visiting cards & biz cards into e business cards using OCR but also lets them export their e business card data to their devices.\n\n- Networking: Eight stands out among others as it not only scans your business cards but also lets you stay linked in with your contacts who are themselves Eight users, by providing options such as private instant chat messaging and an activity feed thus providing you with ample business opportunities and timely updates from your network.\n\nHow does Eight compare to alternatives?\nCamcard: Camcard and most other scanners only uses OCR, not human input, causing significantly lower accuracy.\nBric: Bric and others have scan limits, following which you have to pay. Eight is totally free and unlimited.", "bundleId":"net.8card.eight", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2019-03-13T04:24:43Z", 
"releaseNotes":"For everyone using Eight Premium, we're pleased to announce a new feature:\n\n-  You can now add photos in the notes section.\n\nWhether its a whiteboard captured from a meeting, or slides used in a seminar, you can add those photos to one of your contacts. Now you can recall the moment of exchanging business cards, visually!\n\nMore updates to come soon. Thanks for using Eight!", "genreIds":["6000", "6002"], "formattedPrice":"Free"},

"description":"This app beautifully displays quotes from all over the world to help you get motivation to work.You can choose to use the app simply as it is, or customize to your liking using more than ten features (most number of features for a quotes app). \nWe have been receiving great reviews, with an average of 4.7 stars.\n\n[List of functions]\n\n- Quote display\n- Favorites\n- Autoplay\n- Background and text design customization\n- Play only favorites\n- VoiceOver\n- Regular notification with your favorite quote\n- BGM\n- Snow animation\n- ... and many more (details below in [Function Details]!)\n\n[Function Details]\n\n- Quote display\n\nWe will deliver only the best quotes, carefully picked from around the world. Every time you press the switch in the Quotes page, a new inspirational quote appears.\nQuotes will be added regularly, and you don't have to update the app to get them. You could also switch between different languages at any point from the Settings page (left swipe from the Quotes page).\n\n- Favorites\n\nYou can \"favorite\" a quote by tapping the star icon in the Quotes page. \nYou can see your favorites list from the Settings page. You could also display only the favorites during Autoplay (when using Autoplay feature), or set a quote from your favorites list as a notification message.\n\n- Autoplay\n\nYou could let the app do the switching by tapping the triangle button on the Quotes page. If you feel tired of pressing the switch every time, please try this function. While the triangle icon is rotating, it is in Autoplay mode. You could end Autoplay mode by tapping anywhere on the screen. You could also change the time interval for Autoplay from the Settings page. Autoplay can be used at the same time as VoiceOver.\n\n- Background and text design customization\n\nSwipe to the right to go to the Design Settings page. You could change background image and text design to your liking. Go ahead and look for your favorite combination of background, text color, and text shadow color. \nTip: It tends to look good if you choose the same color for both text color and text shadow color.\nText size can be changed from the Settings page.\n\n- VoiceOver\n\nUnlike any other quotes app, we have VoiceOver function (reading the quotes out loud). This feature is compatible in Japanese and English.\nPlease do understand that it may sound mechanical at times. You could change the overall tone of the voice from the Settings page.\n\n- Regular notification\n\nGo to Settings -> xxx time -> \"choose message\" to register a message from your favorites list as a notification message. Use this to remind and motivate yourself each day.\n\n- BGM\n\nHow about reading inspirational quotes while listening to calm, natural background music? You can choose from three types of sounds from the nature from the Settings page. You could use this to relax before going to bed.\n\n- Snow animation\n\nAs a small gift to users, we prepared a snow animation. Go to the Settings page and turn the feature on, go back to the Quotes page, and let the sakura fall gently down your screen. True, it might block your view a little. But I think it is sometimes nice to feel the nature while reading inspirational quotes. \n\n- Share with friends\n\nTap the arrow icon on the Quotes page, to show a selection of media to share. Currently we have twitter, facebook and LINE. \nYou could also save the image to your camera roll. Turn on your friend's \"switch\" by sharing your favorite quote. \n\n- Finally\n\nThere are more features than what we have explained above, and we are certain that this app will satisfy any quote lover.\nWe are also doing regular updates to accommodate to the latest OS and features. Please try this app out and see how you like it.", "bundleId":"com.chocofactory.BusinesSwitch", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2016-12-20T14:36:17Z", "releaseNotes":"・bug fix", "genreIds":["6000", "6007"], "formattedPrice":"Free"},

"description":"Your network is one of your most valuable assets. At its full potential, it can unlock a whole world of opportunities. But if you’re like most people, building, maintaining, and getting value from your networks is hard. You are surrounded by opportunities: but to capture them, you need a way to see them. Kalido works constantly to help you uncover opportunities to use your skills; find people who have skills you need; and expand your network in ways that create value for you and the people you add.\n\nThis empowers you to offer skills and services, find skilled professionals and meet potential clients, with trust at the core of every interaction. Simply by responding to two simple prompts “I want to meet…” and “I can provide…” and sharing your contacts, you unleash the power of Kalido to find unique and trusted matches for you.\n\nKalido drives incredible networking value for enterprises, schools, conference organisers and attendees.  For enterprises: Kalido enables better onboarding for new joiners (including temporary hires like freelancers and consultants). For schools, Kalido allows alumni to stay connected wherever they are in the world, hire each other more easily, and get introductions and referrals to trusted and skilled people through a community they trust. For conference organisers, attendees find live networking opportunities through immediate matching and browsing, so they can meet, converse and exchange value in minutes.  For everyone else, Kalido removes the middleman, and replaces anonymous reviews with trusted recommendations.\n\nKalido acts as your marketplace for people.  It will find you an awesome local web designer, it will allow you to introduce your friend, who is a freelance photographer, to your private trusted network of local entrepreneurs. It will allow you to make money from your hobby and introduce you to people looking for your skills. Kalido will tell you when a friend or colleague is nearby so you can catch up for that overdue coffee which may lead to a big career opportunity you hadn’t even thought of. It will do all of this, perpetually, infinitely, daily. For free.\n\nWe believe that there should be a level playing field and people should have the environment to create opportunity for themselves no matter who they are.  That’s why we built Kalido.\n\n● Nearby: You are surrounded by talented individuals who can offer useful skills, and Kalido can help you discover them. More importantly, it can help you be discovered too, maybe for local jobs or freelance opportunities. No matter where you are in the world Kalido will tell you who’s around.\n\n● Networks: Join networks to see and match with relevant people nearby, wherever you are in the world. Search and share opportunities with fellow alumni and colleagues. Meet up, chat with, and get introductions to new business clients, professionals, or other alumni. Create your own customised and secure private network and invite colleagues and friends to join.\n\n● Introductions: Do you have a connection who needs to hire a photographer for an upcoming project? Perhaps your friend is a freelance photographer? Why not introduce them to each other online? Kalido gives you the ability to refer and be referred because everybody knows someone.\n\n● Chat: Call, text, or meet up with your matches and trusted contacts directly. Use pre-defined icebreakers to help you get things off the ground and network.\n\n● Trusted matches: we match you with the right people, enabling freelancers to meet new clients, start networking, outsource and succeed in their career. We prioritize matches who have shared contacts, shared networks and are nearby.\n\n● Offer freelancing services: we provide business and job opportunities to freelancers and small businesses to offer their services. Freelancers can meet professional clients who value their work and get jobs at a fair price. Kalido will be your online cv to showcase your skills and experience.", "bundleId":"net.ommobile.samui", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2019-03-13T12:58:11Z", 
"releaseNotes":"• In order to improve security and address user feedback, Kalido no longer automatically adds users as your contacts based on phone book data\n• Now you’ll see a “My Personal Network” network, which lets you individually manage your personal connections by sending and accepting requests\n• When expanding your personal network, you can now search for anyone in your existing networks, and anyone else who has chosen to be findable on Kalido, and request to add them. Once you’ve made a request, and the other person has accepted, they will be part of your personal network\n• In Settings, you can manage your search visibility, to choose whether anyone can find you, or only people in your networks\n• We have replaced the default public environment that all users previously belonged to with a set of geographic networks: These networks are automatically created for countries, cities, and neighbourhoods where Kalido users are active. Anyone can join these networks, allowing everyone an easy way to understand the communities around them. For companies and schools, this also means that during onboarding, a user can choose to join only your private network, creating the option of a completely private Kalido experience for them from Day One\n• Private network admins can now specify an email domain (e.g. my company.com) that will allow anyone with an @mycompany.com email address to automatically join a specific private network\n• When signing up, in addition to adding any custom skill you want, we’ve made it easier to select skills you have, and skills you are looking for, from a curated list\n• When signing up,  we now suggest people that you might know, to make building your personal network easier\n• To improve navigation, the bottom tab bar is now visible at all times, unless you are in an uninterruptible flow (e.g. when recommending someone, introducing someone, or adding a skill, search or interest to your profile).

"description":"Social media platforms keep changing their image sizes and formats and all graphic designers have to keep up with the updates to ensure their content looks good on all platforms. \n\nThat's why we built the first Social Media Design Cheatsheet on iOS. \n\nFor all major platforms (listed below), we listed all the main assets designers are used to creating and for each asset we have listed the optimal size as well as best practice and additional details that will help you get your pixels right. \n\nPlatforms supported: \n- Facebook \n- Twitter\n- LinkedIn\n- Instagram \n- Google+ \n- Pinterest \n- Whatsapp \n- Youtube \n\nWhenever a platform is updated, we update the app accordingly so you are constantly up-to-date with the latest sizes and formats. \n\nThe app covers social media assets, image posts, video posts, and advertising formats and provides sizes in pixels, aspect ratio, video specs, max weight, length and so on. We focus our best practice to what you really need to create good content, no noise, just what's needed.\n\nWe're also open to cover additional platforms and have built in a way for designer and marketers to reach out to us and request add-ons. \n\nAlso feel free to reach out to us at socialmediadesigncheatsheet@gmail.com", "bundleId":"com.edouardbarbier.SocialMediaCheatSheet", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2017-10-15T20:53:14Z", 
"releaseNotes":"Hey guys! \n\nSince I built the first version of this app over one weekend, I wanted to give it a quick facelift to improve your experience with it. \nHopefully, you will like the new UI (a bit more iOS 11 too) :) \n\nLet me know if you feel like I should add anything to the app. I'm also considering adding a way for designers to share their experience with these best practice as they evolve.\nThe idea would that to be able to share your best practice. The community would then be able to upvote/downvote them and once a recommendation reaches a certain score it would be added to the cheatsheet. Let me know what you think. \n\nEnjoy this new update ;)\nCheers, \nEdouard", "genreIds":["6005", "6007"], "formattedPrice":"USD 3.99"},

"description":"Meet in real life with the people who can help you level up and make things happen.\n\nWhile at your local café or favorite lounge, get in Renge to see who everyone is and what they do to start meeting up with the right people.\n\nFeatures:\nMap – find out where the people you want to meet are hanging out\nPlaces – tap on the place you’re at to see who else is there\nProfile Scroll – check out who everyone is, what they do, and where they work\nProfile – double tap their photo to request to meet up\nChat – send a message where to meet up to the people who also want to meet with you\n\nNever Again:\nWonder if the person next to you is someone who can give you your big break \nGo out every night trying to meet as many people as possible, hoping that you’ll meet one person who can get you that dream gig \nHope the person you connected with 3 weeks ago messages you back \nHope to “match” with someone you’d really like to take a meeting with\nSpam as many people as possible online hoping that one will respond \n\nInstead, use Renge to never miss another chance to meet the right people.  Your next producer, director, writer, investor, co-founder, employer could be the person in front of you in line at your next coffee stop.\n\nWhy we do this:\nIn a world of constantly evolving technology created to over simplify our lives, we have ironically felt more isolated despite the growing number of platforms designed to “connect” us.  We’re the ones who follow our passion doing what we love 24/7 and are most likely reading this on our phone.  Our worst nightmare is going to work in a suit for 40 hours/week for the next 40 years.  Kill me now.   And don‘t dare leave me a voicemail – just text me.  Today, meeting strangers online has become the norm but connecting in person devolved into a “soft-skill,” surfacing a host of anxieties in our wifi-raised generation.  \n\nWe share everything from office space to cars to even our homes.  We can work in our sweats half way across the world and use our social media for new business deals because work bleeds into our social lives; as it should, because, when you love what you do - it’s not work.  We don't waste our lives looking forward to the weekend because every day is the weekend.  We’re out and about every day and night taking action to turn our fantasies into a reality.   We know that it’s not just “who you know” but who likes and trusts you.  So we’re always trying to meet the right people in hopes that we may one day work together and inspire the world.   But, how on earth do we meet the right people? \n\nAt Renge, we believe you are always\nin the right place\nat the right time\nwith the right people. \n\nSee Who’s Here", "bundleId":"com.rengeinc.renge", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2019-03-09T20:00:37Z", "releaseNotes":"Automatically removes you from users displayed at a place if your location changes.\nMinor bug fixes.", "genreIds":["6005", "6012"], "formattedPrice":"Free"},

"description":"Rememorate helps you remember the important people that you meet. It’s contact management and CRM app with a focus on easily retrieving and finding their info, even if you can’t remember their name.\n\nWhen you want to remember someone, there are a bunch of ways you can find them -\n\n\nPhoto browse: look through your contact photos to see if you recognize the pic.\n\nMap browse: find them on the map based on where you met.\n\nTimeline browse: look through contacts by date and time that you met.\n\nText search: type in any names, keywords, or notes you remember.\n\n\n\nOther Features -\n\nExport and backup contacts with Dropbox.\nMemory training game.\nBusiness card scanning.\nNote and keyword section for each contact so you can remember the personal details that can make or break a connection! \n\n\nOur mission -\n\nWe believe a contact management app should do more than just store your contacts. Over time it should help you remember more information about the important people in your life.\n\nRememorate stores your address book the same way your brain does, through associations. The more those associations are made, the more likely you are to remember someone without actively needing to reference them.\n\nWhat we mean is, the more you use Rememorate to find who you are looking for, the less work you'll need to do to find them again. Rememorate helps your brain solidify those connections while keeping all their info ready just in case you need a quick reminder. \n\nWant to speed up the process? Rememorate subscriptions include a memory and brain training game using your contacts so you can keep everyone's names and faces fresh in your mind.\n\nRememorate is your personal contact assistant. It isn’t just a remember names app, it helps you remember the important details other address book apps can’t.\n\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe first step to Rememorate someone is to take a photo. That photo will become a visual cue to help you remember that person -- it could be of the person, a selfie with you and the person, or even a photo of something that reminds you of the person/place/time.\n\nFrom there, you can add any other contact info you might have, such as name, phone, email, notes, personal anecdotes, or any other info you want to remember later.\n\nWhen you are ready to find your contact again, you can search your address book by photo, location, time, keywords, or all of the above!\n\n\nDownload now to see why Rememorate is the smartest way to manage your contacts.", "bundleId":"co.rememorate.rememorate", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2018-12-17T21:42:55Z",

"description":"What is it that some women have that make them so successful? This App reveals the tips, techniques, and secrets which are contained in the model The 8 Traits of Successful Women. Gillian Jones-Williams provides a motivating insight into how you can adopt these practices to enhance your own life and career.\n\nWhilst there are many external barriers that women have to overcome in order to achieve the success they desire, there are also many internal barriers. More often than not, confidence is a contributing factor to these barriers. Once women understand that confidence is not constant and that it can be manufactured in different situations they immediately start to feel more in control. Often, women need to change their “limiting” beliefs and, once they understand how to do this, they soon realise they can achieve anything!\n\nThe App provides powerful tools and techniques for increasing confidence and ensuring that “self-talk” is supportive and empowering. Gillian Jones-Williams helps you to set the scene for what makes women successful and how to start changing the thought process. Sue Peckham and James Holmes provide powerful meditations to programme your mind for success and help you live the life you have always dreamed of.\n\nMINDFULNESS MEDITATION SESSION INCLUDED WITH THIS APP:\n\n* Better Public Speaking Mindfulness Meditation\n* Greater Self Confidence Mindfulness Meditation\n* Change Your Self-Limiting Beliefs Mindfulness Meditation\n* No More Self Sabotaging Behaviour Mindfulness Meditation\n* Job Interview Success Mindfulness Meditation\n* Change Your Inner Critical Self Talk Mindfulness Meditation\n* Overcome Your Negative Thoughts Mindfulness Meditation\n* Build Your Self-Esteem Mindfulness Meditation\n* Build Your Positive Mindset Mindfulness Meditation", "bundleId":"uk.co.hantshypno.emerge", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2019-02-25T21:38:28Z", "releaseNotes":"Added analytics.", "genreIds":["6013", "6000"], "formattedPrice":"USD 6.99"},

"description":"STOP meeting people the WRONG way. Mutual acquaintances & friends-of-friends are the best way to create valuable relationships. Period.\nThink about your relationships (business or personal). How many people do you know that:\n- don’t know anyone else you know (e.g. your friend doesn’t know any of your other friends)\nAND\n- you don’t know anyone else that knows them (e.g. no one else you know has met this friend)\n?\nProbably not very many. Chances are, you’ve met many of your friends or colleagues through previous acquaintances, or you’ve introduced them to other people you know.\n\nIntros leverages this basic tenant of human relationships. Stop looking for cold strangers to meet. You are already linked to thousands of people, through the friends of your friends that have not been introduced to you yet:\n* make a new business connection. Your friends can introduce you to someone who is in your industry\n* make a new friend. Who else but your friends would know best about who you are compatible with?\n* reestablish old connections. Suggest a meetup with old acquaintances you haven’t talked to in a while\n\nAPP FEATURES:\n* Easily introduce people from your contact book to each other using SMS or email. Intro’d parties are put in a chat room together.\n* Privacy protected – when you Intro people to each other, their private data is not revealed automatically. They can choose what data about themselves to share using an “Intros Card”. Also, chat messages are HTTPS secured.\n* Intros Card – virtual business cards. Intros Cards are fully customizable: maybe you want to share only a work email with one person but your personal phone number with someone else. Intros Card makes this easy!\n* Track your progress – your activity in the app is used to calculate a “Net Intros Score”. See how your relationships and social clout improve over time as you make more Intros!\n* Your own personal AI assistant – EZRA helps you in many ways. For example, EZRA sends reminders to people who have not responded to you or suggests that you follow-up with certain people.\n\nYou can keep mingling with strangers--or you can create better relationships faster using Intros.", "bundleId":"com.intros.ios", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2018-07-28T20:52:10Z", "releaseNotes":"Check out what your contacts are up to on Intros via your Feed!", "genreIds":["6005", "6007"], "formattedPrice":"Free"},
