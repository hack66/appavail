"description":"Skype keeps the world talking. Say “hello” with an instant message, voice or video call – all for free*, no matter what device they use Skype on. Skype is available on phones, tablets, PCs and Macs.\n\n• Video calls – Don’t just hear the cheers, see them! Get together with 1 or 24 of your friends and family on a HD video call. Watch everyone’s smiles and cries when you tell them “We’re engaged!!!” \n• Chat – Reach people instantly. Send messages to your friends, grab someone’s attention with @ mentions or create a group chat to plan a family reunion. \n• Share – Send photos and videos with your family and friends. Save shared photos and videos to your camera roll. Share your screen to make travel plans with friends or present designs to your team.\n• Voice calls – Camera shy? Make voice calls to anyone in the world on Skype. You can also call mobile and landlines at low rates.\n• Express yourself – Liven up conversations with emoticons, click on the “+” in chat to send a Giphy or images from the web, and annotate images with words, lines and more.\n\n*Skype to Skype calls are free. Operator data charges may apply. We recommend using an unlimited data plan or WiFi connection.\n\nCall landline and device numbers and send SMS messages anywhere in the world at affordable prices using Skype. Reach non-Skype users or contacts who are not online by choosing Skype Credit or Skype subscriptions. \n \nChoose Skype Credit as a pay-as-you-go option to call and SMS. If you call specific destinations, save even more with monthly subscriptions. Skype subscriptions are monthly calling plans that let you make unlimited, or fixed-minute calls to landlines (and mobiles where applicable). Subscriptions begin at $2.99 a month for US, and can vary by destination. To make an in-app purchase, open the app, go to the Call tab and tap on the Skype to Phone banner. Skype Credit and Subscriptions purchased from the Skype app will be charged to your iTunes account when the purchase has been confirmed.\n \nYour account will be charged for Skype subscription renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. Your subscription is renewed automatically unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period of subscription.\n \nYou can manage your subscription by going to your Apple ID account settings and choosing the auto-renewal option or turning it off at any time after your purchase.\n \n• Privacy and Cookies policy: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=507539\n• Microsoft Services Agreement: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=530144", "bundleId":"com.skype.skype", "sellerName":"Skype Communications S.a.r.l", "genreIds":["6005", "6007"], "releaseDate":"2009-03-31T07:00:00Z", "primaryGenreName":"Social Networking", "primaryGenreId":6005, "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "averageUserRating":4.0, "userRatingCount":309},

VPN Express does exactly what, when, & how I need it for a very reasonable price. Best one out there!\"\n\n+++++ Jan 22, 2012 by Neil.D\n\"100% Perfect. 100% of the Time - This is the best VPN solution I have used. It's on my Mac, iPad and iPhone and can be used simultaneously! The pricing plans are awesome as well. Saves me a bundle.\"\n\n+++++ Jan 11, 2012 by Anthony Martinez\n\"Simple, efficient VPN. It just works. - Very easy to use with auto-configure setting. I use this all the time, and find it is great when traveling internationally or when I want greater wifi security in coffee shops. Recommended.\"\n\n+++++ Oct 17, 2011 by Computer Bear\n\"VPN Express - This app is great. Skype was blocked at the hospital where my son was in the NICU. My family and friends could not always travel the 150 mile round trip with us to see the baby. The hospitals IT director was asked to unblock Skype several times. He would not. With this app I went around the firewall. I highly recommend this app.\"", "bundleId":"com.bestsparks.vpnclient", "sellerName":"Express Network Solutions Limited", "genreIds":["6007", "6002"], "releaseDate":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z", "primaryGenreName":"Productivity", "primaryGenreId":6007, "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true},

"description":"A smarter way to book a taxi! Book your cab with Skype to avoid the expense. Use SMS booking to save money and avoid language barriers when abroad. If we can't give you such options, plain old phone booking is of course available.\n\n*** Abroad and not having internet connection? \nWhere possible, Taxican will give you a choice of providers from its on-device database (60+ cities worldwide, growing every day) with hopefully SMS option to book.\n\n*** Have internet connection, but we don't have on-device provider handy?  \nUse built-in online search for a taxi, to book just in two taps. Stores the taxicab you found for you, so you can use it next time, either you are connected or not.\n\n*** Your favorite taxi is not in the online search or on-device list?\nJust add it. All of the booking options, phone, skype, sms are available here to use if provider supports them. No need to approve anything with anyone here. If you like sharing your favorite provider with others and Taxican team, please do. Within a day we add it, so all Taxican users can use it.\n\n*** In a restaurant/office and gps is not really helpful finding your pickup address?\nTaxican integrates with Foursquare to bring you the list of pickup location candidates closest to you. You bet there is a chance the restaurant or your office will be on the list, thus giving you and a taxi driver a perfect pickup address.\n\n*** Booked for few days in advance and can't remember if booked or for when and with whom exactly?\nHistory of last 10 bookings is kept for your convenience. With pickup location if entered, pickup time, taxi provider name and city, just in case! As we are getting older at Taxican this becomes our favorite feature :).\n\n*** A word of disclaimer and encouragement\nWe will try to do our best to find your a taxi with the least expense and hurdle.

This is a great app to have on your iPhone!\"\n\n―\nWHAT IT IS\n\nTransKey is a keyboard extension that translates your messages inside any app (such as iMessage, Whatsapp, Email, and many more).\n\nTransKey also works the other way around. Copy the text you can't understand and TransKey will show you what it means in your native language!\n\n―\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nWrite what you'd like to say, but before sending your message, tap and hold the Globe key to switch to TransKey. After selecting a target language, tap \"Textfield\" and watch your message get translated right in the app! \n\nIf you'd like to translate a message you received, tap and hold it until an option to \"Copy\" appears. In TransKey select \"Clipboard\", and the translation will appear in the same place!\n\n―\n\nNever encounter another language barrier again when communicating with people in other countries! TransKey provides a flawless translation experience right in the messaging app of your choice unlike other translators which interrupt the flow by forcing you to switch to another app.\n\nUnlike other translator keyboards, TransKey does not have keyboard for typing. This allows you to use the keyboard you're most comfortable with, such as the iOS or Swype keyboards.\n\n―\n\nBefore TransKey:\n1. Exit the app you're currently using\n2. Open your preferred translation app\n3. Type what you need to translate\n4. Copy the translated text\n5. Exit the translation app\n6. Open the app from before\n7. Paste translated text\n\nAfter TransKey:\n1. Type what you need to translate\n2. Switch to TransKey\n3. Tap to translate\n\n―\nFEATURES\n\n• Translate the last sentence of any text field directly within any app\n• Translate received messages directly within any app\n• Fast and accurate translation to and from over 100 languages\n• Automatic detection of source language\n• Copy the translation to be used anywhere\n• Optimized for all iPhone screen sizes in both portrait and landscape\n• Preserves capitalization and emojis\n\n―\n\nI built TransKey by myself, so if you enjoy the app please tell your friends about it, write a review on the App Store, or send me your thoughts through the app. I'd greatly appreciate it! \n\n―\nNOTICES\n\nFor accurate real-time translations, TransKey relies on industry leading machine-translation engines such as Google Translate and Yandex Translator. \n\nFull access is needed to communicate with the translator, the keyboard cannot function otherwise. We do not get access to everything you write, only the last sentence of the text field in focus when you are using TransKey. We do not store or keep a record of anything you translate, please read our Privacy Policy for further information.\n\nTerms and Conditions: https://transkey.alekapps.xyz/terms.pdf\nPrivacy Policy: https://transkey.alekapps.xyz/privacy.pdf\n\nTransKey is entirely free to use up to 180 characters per day with Yandex Translate. For a small monthly fee you can upgrade to TransKey Premium, with unlimited high-quality translations using Google Translate. Subscriptions will be charged to your credit card through your iTunes Account and renew automatically unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the period. You will not be able to cancel a subscription during the active period. You can manage your subscriptions in your Account Settings after purchase.\n\n―\nCONTACT ME\n\nAny questions, comments, or concerns? I'd love to hear them!

"description":"**UPDATE** PocketCam now supports audio! Support for FaceTime, iChat/Messages on macs added!\n\n** YouTube Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A69c4HHok3U\n\n** IMPORTANT ** Please turn off Bluetooth on the device (Settings->General->Bluetooth) before using PocketCam. Otherwise, you may experience frame drops/freeze. \n\nWhy paying for an expensive webcam when you can use your awesome iOS device for video conference?  Better yet, your iOS webcam is wireless!  Now you can use your iOS device to show around your house/apartment on your favorite webcam applications such as FaceTime, iChat/Messages, Windows Live or Skype.\n\nPocketCam lets you use your iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad as a wireless webcam (and microphone!) for your Windows-based computer or Mac (OS X 10.7 or above). PocketCam automatically forwards video captured by your iOS camera, which can then be used as if they come from a virtual webcam.\n\nPocketCam works with any Windows-based webcam or video conferencing applications, including instant message applications such as MSN Live Messenger, Skype, AIM, etc.  For Mac users, PocketCam works with any Mac applications that use QuickTime for video capturing, including FaceTime, iChat/Messages, GTalk, Skype and aMSN.\n\nYou can even record the live video from your iOS cam using a webcam recorder such as QuickTime Pro.\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1.  If you have not already done so, download and install the PocketControl for Windows or Mac software from our website: http://www.senstic.com/iPhone/PocketCam/PocketCam.aspx\n\n2.  On Windows, run PocketControl for Windows and make sure the PocketCam service is running on your computer.  On Mac, run PocketControl, and run any application that uses webcam and select PocketCam as your preferred webcam.\n\n3.  Start PocketCam on iOS device, and the app will automatically connect to your computer. The bottom of your iOS screen should display \"Connected to your_computer_name:port.\"\n\n4.  Start any program on your computer that uses webcam, and select \"PocketCam\" as your virtual webcam.\n\nEnjoy live feed from your iOS camera as your webcam source!\n\nStep-by-step instructions can be found at http://www.senstic.com/iphone/pocketcam/Support.aspx\n\nLIMITATIONS:\n\n1.  Currently, PocketCam supports Windows XP/Vista/7/8, Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) or above.\n\n2.  There is a half second delay before the images are shown up on the computer.\n\n\n*** If you have problem getting PocketCam to work, please contact us at support@senstic.com, and we will help you fix the problem.", "bundleId":"com.yourcompany.CamSource", "sellerName":"Senstic", "genreIds":["6002", "6008"], "releaseDate":"2009-12-01T18:26:02Z", "primaryGenreName":"Utilities", "primaryGenreId":6002, "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true},
