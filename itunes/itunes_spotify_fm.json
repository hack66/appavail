So what if anybody can do the same with only a little effort? Maybe the playlist you build could be astonishing and you will be the next DJ in Tomorrowland!\n\nYou will have two new features for Spotify:\n\nThe first one is helping you to find great playlists that already exists and if you want to follow them you can directly from the app.\n\nThe second one is helping you to create awesome playlists based on the playlists you love. We've build a \"bot\" that do the hard work for you. So this is the idea:\n\n* You create a new playlist or use an existing one.\n* Then, you synchronize to this playlists other playlists you love or follow.\n* Once you have some playlists you thing that are great, the bot will copy them to your own playlist every 15 minutes. In other words, each time that a playlist you love adds a song, it will be automatically added to your playlist.\n\nWhy this will help me? Because you will be able to delete the songs you don't like and the \"bot\" will add every song you may love because of the other playlists.\n\nThis will save you a lot of time to create your best playlist ever and share it in the social media!\n\n\n*** Please note: This app is not affiliated with Spotify but It’s required to have an account of Spotify to use the app.", "bundleId":"com.danigil.megaplaylists", "trackName":"Megaplaylists for Spotify", "releaseDate":"2018-02-22T00:23:14Z", "primaryGenreName":"Music", "primaryGenreId":6011, "formattedPrice":"USD 8.99", "sellerName":"Daniel Gil", "minimumOsVersion":"9.0"},

"description":"JOIN THE PLAYLIST !\nDecide the music together\n\nWaveUp is the coolest collaborative playlist application. It allows you to decide what music is played at parties, instantly and from your phone.\n\n● How does it work?\nAll you have to do is create a room by giving it a name and an emoji code. You can then invite your friends to join it so that together you can add your music.\nThe coolest thing: Everyone can enjoy their favorite music and bring it up to the top of the playlist! The most liked song will be played first!\n\n● Where does the music come from?\nThe person who creates a room must sign in to a premium Spotify account to enable music addition. Don't have one? Let a Spotify subscriber create the room. You can then join it, add music and like or dislike the songs in the room. WaveUp will soon be available with Deezer and Apple Music.\n\nFollow us !\nFacebook: WaveUp\nInstagram: waveupapp\nTwitter: @waveupapp", "bundleId":"com.nolane.waveup-app", "trackName":"WaveUp", "releaseDate":"2019-03-14T13:38:33Z", "primaryGenreName":"Music", "primaryGenreId":6011, "formattedPrice":"Free", "sellerName":"Nolane Brullefert", "minimumOsVersion":"11.0"},

"description":"Hi Guys,\n\nWe are a British Rock Band called Leo Steel and we are very grateful to be able to bring you our first single Funk Revolution through our app.\n\nFunk was first written as a protest song, directed at anyone trying to tell you how to live your own life and about the freedom that comes with trusting yourself. As it has progressed, the original meaning still holds true but we now see it as a song to unite the people against the establishment telling us what to do. This message is needed now more than ever. Because of this, we need your support.

Try PaceDJ for free to see how you like it!  Then upgrade to Premium for features including intervals training, dislike button, and remove ads.  \n\n•We're Unique: PaceDJ is the ONLY APP that speeds up or slows down BPMs to match your running pace AND allows you to create interval workouts.   \n\n•Like Intervals?
