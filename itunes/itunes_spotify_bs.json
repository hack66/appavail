"description":"\"Hook is exactly what the doctor ordered. Many apps came close but you nailed it.\" —DJ puzzle\n\n\"Hook is definitely the most fun I've had making music on iOS.  The sampling options are vast and the editing is intuitive.  It's connectivity and versatility makes it a powerful performance tool and production sketchbook.\" — Starkey\n\n5 STARS \"Most impressive DJ mashup & sampler / editor I've seen on iOS so far! It's like the best of all other apps combined in one and all of the latest developments integrated like recording or importing ur own music and inter-app audio.\" — App Store Review\n\n====\nThis is the free iPhone version of Hook. There's also an iPad version for 13 bucks. The feature sets are identical, but the iPad version is optimized for the larger screen, including iPad Pro. The iPad version also comes with 4 additional sound packs with over 500 samples.\n====\n\nHook is a new music performance, mashup, and DJ app for iPhone and iPad. Arrange and trigger loops on a grid and create dynamic, expressive transitions with the Flux Fader — a multitouch \"smart crossfader\" that allows you to expressively make transitions between any combination of tracks/cells on the fly. The Flux Fader includes a two-axis control with 9 riser synths, glitch and gate effects, tempo-synced filter sweeps, an EQ, beat drop, tape stop, and filter drop. Combining all these to make transitions is the heart of playing live with Hook. Hook includes a full editor complete with auto transient slicing and waveform editing. Tight integration with AudioCopy makes it easy to drop in your own loops and sounds from other apps.\n\nReal creative power can be found in the integrated sampler — record from mic/line, other apps via inter-app audio, and grab hooks from iTunes and Spotify. Change tempo in real time, and keep all your hooks in sync. Hook is a killer mashup tool with a full mixer, tons of tracks, integrated FX bus, per-cell fx, transpose, time stretching, tuning, timing and trigger settings, and more. Imagine the clip launching capabilities of Ableton Live in a futuristic multitouch environment.\n\n====\nExtend Hook with Wej!\nWej is an iOS music hub that combines a non-skid performance base with integrated lightshow and wireless MIDI for up to two controllers — all while keeping your iOS device charged.

So this is the idea:\n\n* You create a new playlist or use an existing one.\n* Then, you synchronize to this playlists other playlists you love or follow.\n* Once you have some playlists you thing that are great, the bot will copy them to your own playlist every 15 minutes. In other words, each time that a playlist you love adds a song, it will be automatically added to your playlist.\n\nWhy this will help me? Because you will be able to delete the songs you don't like and the \"bot\" will add every song you may love because of the other playlists.\n\nThis will save you a lot of time to create your best playlist ever and share it in the social media!\n\n\n*** Please note: This app is not affiliated with Spotify but It’s required to have an account of Spotify to use the app.", "currency":"USD", "bundleId":"com.danigil.megaplaylists", "trackId":1241756692, "minimumOsVersion":"9.0", "genreIds":["6011", "6007"], "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2018-02-22T00:23:14Z"},

It allows you to decide what music is played at parties, instantly and from your phone.\n\n● How does it work?\nAll you have to do is create a room by giving it a name and an emoji code. You can then invite your friends to join it so that together you can add your music.\nThe coolest thing: Everyone can enjoy their favorite music and bring it up to the top of the playlist! The most liked song will be played first!\n\n● Where does the music come from?\nThe person who creates a room must sign in to a premium Spotify account to enable music addition. Don't have one? Let a Spotify subscriber create the room. You can then join it, add music and like or dislike the songs in the room. WaveUp will soon be available with Deezer and Apple Music.\n\nFollow us !\nFacebook: WaveUp\nInstagram: waveupapp\nTwitter: @waveupapp", "currency":"USD", "bundleId":"com.nolane.waveup-app", "trackId":1448007624, "minimumOsVersion":"11.0", "genreIds":["6011"], "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2019-03-14T13:38:33Z"},

"description":"Wake up to your favorite music with the Music Alarm Clock for Spotify!\n\n\"It's Easy as 1-2-3\":\n1. Search for a Spotify song.\n2. Set up the days to repeat, as well as your Custom Snooze and all other features any good alarm app should have.\n3. Lock your screen, relax, and wake up on the right side of the bed.\n\nNotes:\n• A paid Spotify premium account is NOT needed, a Free Spotify Account works!\n• The Spotify App is NOT needed, since this uses the Web\n• Internet connectivity is required to \"set\" an alarm, but not when it goes off\n• This app uses the ringer to go off, like any other alarm app, so I recommend going into Settings and scheduling Do Not Disturb to silence your ringer until right before your alarm goes off. This is optional.\n• Due to legal restrictions, the app plays 30 seconds of the song you choose\n• Note that every song in existence is not available; it must be on Spotify, and Spotify must have allowed the clips to be played through the API", "currency":"USD", "bundleId":"com.willsaid.Music-Alarm-for-Spotify", "trackId":1439527300, "minimumOsVersion":"10.3", "genreIds":["6011", "6002"], "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2019-01-30T17:50:30Z"}]
