     'VPN + TOR is the only app featuring both a VPN and a TOR browser. VPN + TOR is the most secure and advanced browser that allows you to choose between the speed and ease of use of VPNs tunnel connection and the advanced protection offered by the TOR network.\n \nAre you sure none is spying on you? Nowadays, anonymous surfing on the web is increasingly important in order to protect your personal data 360 degrees. This is valid not only when you browse incognito from a laptop, but also when you use your iPhone and you want to shield your private informations. The TOR (The Onion Router) Network protects you by bouncing your communications around a distributed network of relays run by volunteers all around the world: it prevents somebody watching your Internet connection from learning what sites you visit, and it prevents the sites you visit from learning your physical location. Moreover, it\'s suitable for travellers who need to access different kind of contents from abroad.\n \nIf you use this application you will enjoy the following features for free:\n- Your Internet access will be tunnelled over the Tor network.\n- Websites will not see your real IP address, as when you use a proxy, and the traffic from your browser would look to be originated from another place. Moreover your connection is encrypted.\n- ISPs and insecure wireless networks won\'t see your browsing. It will be difficult for anybody to trace your internet activities back to your device.\n- You will be able to access .onion websites which are only accessible through the TOR network.\n- Advanced browsing capability with tabs, and popover detection and blocking.\n- You can automatically delete cookies, cache and third party data on application exit.\n- Support for audio and video playback.\n- Easy to use interface: just one button to connect to the closest server!\n\nIf you purchase our Premium subscription you will also be able to enjoy the following advanced features:\n- Ads-Free experience.\n- Unlimited VPN Session duration.\n- Priority Support.\n \nVPN + TOR is the allay for data safety you can trust. Download it now and secure your mobile browser: it\'s fast and easy, you just need to tap a button to enjoy full anonymity. Be untraceable wherever you are, choose unlimited privacy and security!\n\n-------------------\nSUBSCRIPTION INFO:\n\nSubscribe to take advantage of all the features described above.\n• Subscription length: weekly, monthly, yearly\n• Your payment will be charged to your iTunes Account as soon as you confirm your purchase.\n• You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal from your Account Settings after the purchase.\n• Your subscription will renew automatically, unless you turn off auto-renew at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n• The cost of renewal will be charged to your account in the 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n• When canceling a subscription, your subscription will stay active until the end of the period. Auto-renewal will be disabled, but the current subscription will not be refunded.\n• Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when purchasing a subscription.\n\nTerms of service: https://bendingspoons.com/tos.html?app=961073150\nPrivacy policy: https://bendingspoons.com/privacy.html?app=961073150\n\nHave a feature request you would like to see in a future version of the app?

     'VPNHUB protects your online privacy and masks your IP. With thousands of servers in over 60 countries, our VPN lets you access sites and streaming from anywhere on the planet, without losing one second of browsing speed. It’s an armored car with a supersonic jet engine.\n\nThe reality today is that the internet is full of restrictions, censorship, privacy invasions, security breaches, and a host of unwanted entities trafficking in your personal data. What a downer!\n\nVPNHUB is your first-class ticket to that original ideal of a truly secure and private internet. It is the most powerful, most reliable and most secure VPN service in existence. Right on!\n\nYou can try VPNHUB right now, without even needing to register! Go ahead and kiss the following problems goodbye, like that time you…\n\n… once bought a tent online and got bombarded with camping equipment ads, or\n… wanted to access news from your home country while abroad but got blocked, or\n… were denied banking assistance because you once visited some online gambling sites, or\n… had your personal data stolen because you used the Wi-Fi at your local café, etc.\n\nVPNHUB is the total solution to all of the above problems and more!\n\nStandard Features:\n* American VPN Servers\n* Military-Grade Encryption\n* Hide Your IP and Location\n* Bypass Censorship\n* Access Public Wi-Fi Securely\n\nVPNHUB Premium includes:\n* Global Video Streaming\n* Servers in 60+ Locations\n* Apps for Desktop \n* Multiple Devices At Once\n* Top Speeds & Zero Data Caps\n\n* Unblock Global Video Streaming\nWatch TV, movies and live sports from any country no matter where you are. VPNHUB spoofs your IP, letting you connect from the VPN server of your choice. Forget angry border guards, VPNHUB is your diplomatic immunity to the world’s most popular sites. \n\n* Bye Bye Censorship\nWith censorship and information control on the rise, the internet can seem like a dark place. VPNHUB transforms the internet into a tool of liberation!\n \n* Avoid Getting Hacked on Public Wi-Fi\nSure it\'s convenient to get online using the internet at your local coffee shop, but using public Wi-Fi is like living in a glass house with no locks on the doors. Not only are you at risk of having an unwanted audience, but people can stroll right in to steal your personal data, like passwords and photos. VPNHUB encrypts all of your communications over public Wi-Fi.\n\n* Privacy Protection and Location Masking\nYour ISP may keep logs of every website you visit. Other VPNs may do it too. VPNHUB does not, end of story! It’s like wherever you browse, we’re the forensic clean-up crew covering your tracks, and then we wipe our own memories too. And not only your browsing, but we’ll mask your true location by routing your data through our full stack of encrypted global servers.  \n\n* Servers in 60+ Locations\nStandard users get unlimited access to our United States servers. That’s a decent place to start, but why stay put in one spot? Go further. Go global. Go Premium, and get access to servers from over 60 countries in far-flung lands, like from Austria to Australia, from Malaysia to Mexico, or the UK to the UAE, and beyond.\n\nVPNHUB Premium Subscription Details:\n- 7 day free trial offer is commitment free, can be cancelled anytime.\n- Payments charged to user\'s iTunes Account upon purchase.\n- Subscription lengths and prices: one month ($15.99), one year (89.88).\n- Auto-renewal unless cancelled 24 hours prior to subscription ending.\n- Subscriptions may be managed or cancelled through the user\'s Account Settings.\n- No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during an active subscription period.\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.appatomic.net/privacy_policy.php\nTerms: https://www.appatomic.net/tos.php',

     'BENEFITS\n\nGive VPN in Touch a try on your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch, and discover for yourself that it’s the fastest and the most secure mobile VPN service around.\n\n\n+ Security and Privacy Always Matter:\nYou’re going to use a public hotspot for online banking? Oh wait! Sniffers are watching your data. Before sending your private data over the net, encrypt it by connecting to our VPN servers.\nFurthermore, you can conceal your digital identity when you’re connected to a VPN, keeping your activity anonymous and difficult to follow.\n\n+ VPN on Demand (Always On):\nFor most VPNs, if your iPhone enters sleep mode your VPN is disconnected. But now, with the help of \'VPN on Demand\', VPN in Touch will be turned on as soon as you connect to WiFi or a 3G network. Your internet usage is always secure and protected.\n\n+ Data Saving:\nEnable this feature in the app and your 3G/4G data usage on your iPhone will be decreased noticeably thanks to our unique data compression algorithm! With VPN in Touch you can significantly reduce the cost of using your data abroad.\n \n+ Ad Blocking:\nTired of ads cluttering your iPhone or iPad screen while you’re browsing the web?

     'Worried about unprotected Wi-Fi hotspots? Touch VPN – the unlimited VPN – is the solution for you!\n\n***** Highlights of Touch VPN *****\n\n-- Free (with Ads):  To remove ads, you can choose monthly or yearly subscription.\n\n-- Unlimited: Truly unlimited. No session, speed or bandwidth limitations.  \n\n-- Simple: Open the world with just one touch of the “Connect” button. \n\n-- Secured:  Strong SSL encryption will make your browsing secure.\n\n-- Support: We want to be one of the best VPN choices for you, and are always open to feedbacks and suggestions. Just shoot an email to support!\n\n-------------\n\nWhat is a VPN: VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. When connecting to a VPN server through Touch VPN for example - it sets up a secured and encrypted connection to an external server. Because of the encryption process, the data cannot be filtered.\n\nWhy using a VPN: With a VPN, your online privacy and security will be greatly bolstered as you’ll be surfing the web protected.\n\nVPN vs. Proxy: VPN and Proxy can both conceal user identity through re-routing your internet traffic. A Proxy server is, however, completely browser-based, and might not be compatible with certain web pages that use non-browser technology. Unlike a Proxy, a VPN service encrypts all your traffic and will work with all internet based services. In summary, VPN will provide you with more online privacy and security.\n\nWith Touch VPN you can：\n\n* When you’re connected to a public Wi-Fi Hotspot, your name, passwords, and personal information can be easily compromised. Touch VPN encrypts your data and provides you with banking-level security for the best protection. \n\n* Touch VPN is a one-click VPN Proxy Service. Touch VPN contains only one button. The button connects you to one of many servers at speeds faster than a web proxy. When you are not running our app we help you save your device\'s battery.\n\n* Surf the Web Privately.  Your real IP address is concealed and your internet activity is inaccessible to prying eyes and businesses.\n\n--------------\n\nSubscription:\n\nYou can be an Elite user through auto-renewable subscription. Choose between monthly and yearly plans and enjoy VPN with no Ads from virtual location of your choice.\n\n– Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n– Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n– Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n– Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user\'s Account Settings after purchase\n– Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nLegal:\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.northghost.com/privacy\nTerms of Service: https://www.northghost.com/terms',
