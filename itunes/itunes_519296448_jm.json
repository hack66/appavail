"description":"Onion Browser is the original free and open-source Tor-powered web browser for iOS. Onion Browser helps you access the internet with more safety and privacy, and no extra cost to you.\n\n“The best Tor-related offering on iOS right now is Onion Browser” - The Daily Dot, October 14, 2015.\n\nFeatured in: The New York Times, The Guardian, Salon, TechCrunch, Gizmodo, Boing Boing, Lifehacker, Macworld, The Daily Dot, & others.\n\nFEATURES:\n• Browse the internet over Tor:\n- Protect your privacy from website tracking\n- Secure your traffic from insecure wireless networks and ISPs\n- Support for HTTPS Everywhere, an automatic switch to HTTPS enabled websites\n- Access .onion sites that are only accessible over Tor.\n\n• Fight online tracking: block scripts and automatically clear cookies and tabs, based on your preferences.\n\n• And more privacy-enhancing features!\n\nDISCLAIMERS:\n- Web browsing is much slower than through a normal web browser or a VPN because your traffic is encrypted and relayed through the Tor network.\n\n- Multimedia often bypass Tor and compromise your privacy; video files and video streams are blocked by default and are not supported by Onion Browser.\n\n- Onion Browser might not work on networks with advanced network restrictions. If the app does not connect, try using bridges (or a different type of bridge), force-quit, and then restart the app.\n\n- Use of Onion Browser is at your own risk; remember that sensitive data does not always belong on a mobile device.\n\n** Onion Browser is free and open-source software.
