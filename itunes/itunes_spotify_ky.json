"description":"Run longer, faster, and stronger with PaceDJ, the only app that modifies music BPMs to match your running pace AND allows you to create interval workouts.  There is no better running music app – Period. Get it now!\n\nRECOMMENDED BY:\n•New York Times\n•Washington Post\n•Health Magazine\n•Runner’s World \n•Men’s Health\n•Women’s Health\n•RealSimple\n•And more!\n\nWHY WE’RE BETTER THAN OTHER APPS\n\n•We're Personalized: PaceDJ lets you use the songs you have saved in your iTunes library.  This means you are in control of your playlists.  Other services provide random playlists created by DJs who don't know your tastes.  \n\n•We're Precise: Some apps claim they can serve songs at BPMs to pace you to a specific minute/mile time.  Unless they know your stride length, they can't do this accurately.   PaceDJ helps you find the right BPM first, and then fine tune to match your mile time goal.  \n\n•We're Free! Try PaceDJ for free to see how you like it!  Then upgrade to Premium for features including intervals training, dislike button, and remove ads.  \n\n•We're Unique: PaceDJ is the ONLY APP that speeds up or slows down BPMs to match your running pace AND allows you to create interval workouts.   \n\n•Like Intervals?  We've got that! Create custom interval workouts or choose from pre-programmed templates.\n\n•Each song you own can pace you at multiple levels – a massive increase in the usefulness of your music library\n\n•PaceDJ.com provides a FREE music discovery service so you can find and purchase songs that match your running pace.\n\n•Echonest song database has over 35million songs and 2.8 million artists.\n\n•Easily correct BPMs by tapping on the drum. \n\nUSER REVIEWS: \n•\"I love this app, I use it to crank up speed work for marathon training without my pace conflicting with my music!\"\n\n•\"PaceDJ allowed me to find tunes that helped me pace myself… and spend my energy focusing on…proper running form. I use PaceDJ on every run.\"\n\n•\"PaceDJ gives me that extra boost of motivation. It gives me the proper speeds I need to stay on pace and even ramp up my speed work.\"\n\nON THE WEB AT WWW.PACEDJ.COM\n\nTECHNICAL INFORMATION\nv2.0 requires iOS9.0 and higher.\n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background in PaceDJ can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE:\ncustomerservice@pacedj.com\n\n\nTHIS APP AND ANY INFORMATION GIVEN BY IT ARE NOT INTENDED NOR IMPLIED TO BE A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL ADVICE.

"description":"\"Hook is exactly what the doctor ordered. Many apps came close but you nailed it.\" —DJ puzzle\n\n\"Hook is definitely the most fun I've had making music on iOS.  The sampling options are vast and the editing is intuitive.  It's connectivity and versatility makes it a powerful performance tool and production sketchbook.\" — Starkey\n\n5 STARS \"Most impressive DJ mashup & sampler / editor I've seen on iOS so far! It's like the best of all other apps combined in one and all of the latest developments integrated like recording or importing ur own music and inter-app audio.\" — App Store Review\n\n====\nThis is the free iPhone version of Hook. There's also an iPad version for 13 bucks. The feature sets are identical, but the iPad version is optimized for the larger screen, including iPad Pro. The iPad version also comes with 4 additional sound packs with over 500 samples.\n====\n\nHook is a new music performance, mashup, and DJ app for iPhone and iPad. Arrange and trigger loops on a grid and create dynamic, expressive transitions with the Flux Fader — a multitouch \"smart crossfader\" that allows you to expressively make transitions between any combination of tracks/cells on the fly. The Flux Fader includes a two-axis control with 9 riser synths, glitch and gate effects, tempo-synced filter sweeps, an EQ, beat drop, tape stop, and filter drop. Combining all these to make transitions is the heart of playing live with Hook. Hook includes a full editor complete with auto transient slicing and waveform editing. Tight integration with AudioCopy makes it easy to drop in your own loops and sounds from other apps.\n\nReal creative power can be found in the integrated sampler — record from mic/line, other apps via inter-app audio, and grab hooks from iTunes and Spotify. Change tempo in real time, and keep all your hooks in sync. Hook is a killer mashup tool with a full mixer, tons of tracks, integrated FX bus, per-cell fx, transpose, time stretching, tuning, timing and trigger settings, and more. Imagine the clip launching capabilities of Ableton Live in a futuristic multitouch environment.\n\n====\nExtend Hook with Wej!\nWej is an iOS music hub that combines a non-skid performance base with integrated lightshow and wireless MIDI for up to two controllers — all while keeping your iOS device charged.

We've build a \"bot\" that do the hard work for you. So this is the idea:\n\n* You create a new playlist or use an existing one.\n* Then, you synchronize to this playlists other playlists you love or follow.\n* Once you have some playlists you thing that are great, the bot will copy them to your own playlist every 15 minutes. In other words, each time that a playlist you love adds a song, it will be automatically added to your playlist.\n\nWhy this will help me? Because you will be able to delete the songs you don't like and the \"bot\" will add every song you may love because of the other playlists.\n\nThis will save you a lot of time to create your best playlist ever and share it in the social media!\n\n\n*** Please note: This app is not affiliated with Spotify but It’s required to have an account of Spotify to use the app.", "artistId":1144552503, "artistName":"Daniel Gil", "genres":["Music", "Productivity"], "price":8.99, "bundleId":"com.danigil.megaplaylists", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2018-02-22T00:23:14Z", "formattedPrice":"USD 8.99", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "genreIds":["6011", "6007"], "minimumOsVersion":"9.0"},

"description":"JOIN THE PLAYLIST !\nDecide the music together\n\nWaveUp is the coolest collaborative playlist application. It allows you to decide what music is played at parties, instantly and from your phone.\n\n● How does it work?\nAll you have to do is create a room by giving it a name and an emoji code. You can then invite your friends to join it so that together you can add your music.\nThe coolest thing: Everyone can enjoy their favorite music and bring it up to the top of the playlist! The most liked song will be played first!\n\n● Where does the music come from?\nThe person who creates a room must sign in to a premium Spotify account to enable music addition. Don't have one? Let a Spotify subscriber create the room. You can then join it, add music and like or dislike the songs in the room. WaveUp will soon be available with Deezer and Apple Music.\n\nFollow us !\nFacebook: WaveUp\nInstagram: waveupapp\nTwitter: @waveupapp", "artistId":1448007623, "artistName":"Nolane Brullefert", "genres":["Music"], "price":0.00, "bundleId":"com.nolane.waveup-app", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2019-03-14T13:38:33Z", "formattedPrice":"Free", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "genreIds":["6011"], "minimumOsVersion":"11.0"},
