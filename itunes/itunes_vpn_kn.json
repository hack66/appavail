"description":"+++300MB VPN data for FREE!+++Best Online Game Accelerator+++Access VOIP & Facebook, YouTube, Hulu, Skype, Instagram, SnapChat, Netflix smoothly!+++Auto-setup all your devices (iPhone, iPad, iTouch)+++Servers in United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, France, Hong Kong and Germany!\n\nWHAT IS IT?\nVPN is a 128-bit encrypted tunnel between your device (computer, iPhone/iTouch/iPad) and one of our servers.\n\nWHY HAVE A VPN ACCOUNT?\nIf you want a total Internet traffic anonymizing experience, a VPN account is the best way to go - there’s no IP numbers to configure into the webapps, and no software to install - just set up the VPN and it’s done! Other features include, but are not limited to:\n\n- Use VOIP service from anywhere\n- Accelerate online games: get extremely low latency when playing Order & Chaos, MetalStorm online and etc.\n- Assigns your computer a new IP address, hides your real IP to anonymize all web applications.\n- A secure encrypted connection between your computer and the Internet.\n- Secure your wireless (Wi-Fi) connection at home or at public Hotspots.\n- Unlike a proxy, you get secured connection for all programs you are using, (e.g ICQ, Email, FTP, News and anything that uses a Internet Connection)\n\nWHY USE VPN EXPRESS FOR YOUR VPN SERVICES?\n- Support All VPN Protocols available in iOS devices: IPSec, L2TP over IPSec and PPTP!\n- Lowest Rates with 24x7 availability! 99% service up time! Beat any other competitors in market!\n- Optimized for iPhone/iPad/iTouch communication\n- Quality Network ensures your VPN service will be fast wherever you are in the world\n\nWHAT OUR CUSTOMERS SAY:\n+++++ Mar 2, 2012 by DrRhysB\n\"Excellent App! - I had tried several VPN plans before this & wasn't satisfied with the through-put consistency. VPN Express does exactly what, when, & how I need it for a very reasonable price. Best one out there!\"\n\n+++++ Jan 22, 2012 by Neil.D\n\"100% Perfect. 100% of the Time - This is the best VPN solution I have used. It's on my Mac, iPad and iPhone and can be used simultaneously! The pricing plans are awesome as well. Saves me a bundle.\"\n\n+++++ Jan 11, 2012 by Anthony Martinez\n\"Simple, efficient VPN. It just works. - Very easy to use with auto-configure setting. I use this all the time, and find it is great when traveling internationally or when I want greater wifi security in coffee shops. Recommended.\"\n\n+++++ Oct 17, 2011 by Computer Bear\n\"VPN Express - This app is great. Skype was blocked at the hospital where my son was in the NICU. My family and friends could not always travel the 150 mile round trip with us to see the baby. The hospitals IT director was asked to unblock Skype several times. He would not. With this app I went around the firewall. I highly recommend this app.\"", "bundleId":"com.bestsparks.vpnclient", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "formattedPrice":"Free"},

Moreover your connection is encrypted.\n- ISPs and insecure wireless networks won't see your browsing. It will be difficult for anybody to trace your internet activities back to your device.\n- You will be able to access .onion websites which are only accessible through the TOR network.\n- Advanced browsing capability with tabs, and popover detection and blocking.\n- You can automatically delete cookies, cache and third party data on application exit.\n- Support for audio and video playback.\n- Easy to use interface: just one button to connect to the closest server!\n\nIf you purchase our Premium subscription you will also be able to enjoy the following advanced features:\n- Ads-Free experience.\n- Unlimited VPN Session duration.\n- Priority Support.\n \nVPN + TOR is the allay for data safety you can trust.

Because of the encryption process, the data cannot be filtered.\n\nWhy using a VPN: With a VPN, your online privacy and security will be greatly bolstered as you’ll be surfing the web protected.\n\nVPN vs. Proxy: VPN and Proxy can both conceal user identity through re-routing your internet traffic. A Proxy server is, however, completely browser-based, and might not be compatible with certain web pages that use non-browser technology. Unlike a Proxy, a VPN service encrypts all your traffic and will work with all internet based services. In summary, VPN will provide you with more online privacy and security.\n\nWith Touch VPN you can：\n\n* When you’re connected to a public Wi-Fi Hotspot, your name, passwords, and personal information can be easily compromised. Touch VPN encrypts your data and provides you with banking-level security for the best protection. \n\n* Touch VPN is a one-click VPN Proxy Service. Touch VPN contains only one button. The button connects you to one of many servers at speeds faster than a web proxy. When you are not running our app we help you save your device's battery.\n\n* Surf the Web Privately.  Your real IP address is concealed and your internet activity is inaccessible to prying eyes and businesses.\n\n--------------\n\nSubscription:\n\nYou can be an Elite user through auto-renewable subscription.

"description":"Your big screen on your pocket screen. Anywhere.\n\nRemote Desktop allows you to connect to any Windows computer using your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. The app uses Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to connect to any Windows that has support for Terminal Services.\n\nFEATURES: \n\n* It is an universal app so you only have to purchase the full version once and then use it on all your devices.\n\n* perfect for low speed connections. When you're on a slow speed network choose \"Low quality images\" and 640x480 resolution. This minimizes the required bandwith.\n\n* emulates the mouse. You can left-click, right-click and even double click. Drag & drop is also implemented.\n\n* zoom and pan the remote desktop screen as in the Safari browser.\n\n* Safari-like page view for switching between multiple concurrent sessions\n\n* connect to any version of Windows starting with XP, except all Home and Starter versions. From all these editions Microsoft removed the Terminal Services.\n\n* uses the bigger screen size of iPhone 5\n\nQUICK START GUIDE:\n\nTo start using Remote Desktop tap \"Add PC\" from the bottom toolbar. Add a name for the entry, the hostname (or IP address), your username and password and choose the image quality and resolution. Tap Save when you're done.\n\nIn the main screen you will see the new entry. Tap on it to connect, swipe it to delete it or tap the disclosure icon to edit the computer's informations.\n\nOn slow network connections choose low image quality and a low resolution to insure proper screen updates. Also be aware that iPod Touches tend to work slow when choosing higher image resolutions.\n\nBUY ONCE, USE IT ON ALL YOUR DEVICES:\n\nThe app is free so you can download it and test it with your PCs configuration without having to pay in advance. If it works with your configuration (routers, firewalls, etc) then you can disable the ads by purchasing an in-app product that costs 0.99$. The app in it's free version is a fully functional app, so you can test every option before deciding to buy.\n\nAfter purchasing the in-app feature on one device, you can disable the banners on all your devices (iPads, iPhones, iPod Touches) without having to pay again, as long as you use the same iTunes account. To do this you have to go through the purchase process on each additional device. Hit 'Disable Ads', confirm the purchase and a message from iTunes will confirm you already bought the product and the banners will be disabled.\n\n************************** \nIf the ads are shown again after a reinstall go through the purchase process again to remove them. You won't be charged again. This only re-activates the in-app product on the device.\n**************************\n\nVERSION HISTORY: \n\nVersion 1.1:\n* added a new scissor icon in the upper toolbar when a connection is open and active. When touched it brings up a set of text edit commands: CTRL+C (Copy), CTRL+X (Cut), CTRL+V (Paste), CTRL+Z(Undo), CTRL+F (Find), CTRL+R (Replace). \n\n* added a new setting to the connection settings: Use Console. Enable this switch if you want to connect to the console session. \n\nVersion 1.2:\n* updated the screen size to take advantage of the larger screen of iPhone 5\n\n***********************************\nPlease read our Support section at \nhttp://rdp.bamtoo.com/support/ \nor email us if you can't connect to your PC. And make sure you activated Remote Desktop Services in your Windows system, you connect to your external IP address and you forwarded calls to RDP port if you use a wireless router in your home.\n***********************************", "bundleId":"ro.evolve.rdp", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "formattedPrice":"Free"},

"description":"VPNHUB protects your online privacy and masks your IP. With thousands of servers in over 60 countries, our VPN lets you access sites and streaming from anywhere on the planet, without losing one second of browsing speed. It’s an armored car with a supersonic jet engine.\n\nThe reality today is that the internet is full of restrictions, censorship, privacy invasions, security breaches, and a host of unwanted entities trafficking in your personal data. What a downer!\n\nVPNHUB is your first-class ticket to that original ideal of a truly secure and private internet. It is the most powerful, most reliable and most secure VPN service in existence. Right on!\n\nYou can try VPNHUB right now, without even needing to register! Go ahead and kiss the following problems goodbye, like that time you…\n\n… once bought a tent online and got bombarded with camping equipment ads, or\n… wanted to access news from your home country while abroad but got blocked, or\n… were denied banking assistance because you once visited some online gambling sites, or\n… had your personal data stolen because you used the Wi-Fi at your local café, etc.\n\nVPNHUB is the total solution to all of the above problems and more!\n\nStandard Features:\n* American VPN Servers\n* Military-Grade Encryption\n* Hide Your IP and Location\n* Bypass Censorship\n* Access Public Wi-Fi Securely\n\nVPNHUB Premium includes:\n* Global Video Streaming\n* Servers in 60+ Locations\n* Apps for Desktop \n* Multiple Devices At Once\n* Top Speeds & Zero Data Caps\n\n* Unblock Global Video Streaming\nWatch TV, movies and live sports from any country no matter where you are. VPNHUB spoofs your IP, letting you connect from the VPN server of your choice. Forget angry border guards, VPNHUB is your diplomatic immunity to the world’s most popular sites. \n\n* Bye Bye Censorship\nWith censorship and information control on the rise, the internet can seem like a dark place. VPNHUB transforms the internet into a tool of liberation!\n \n* Avoid Getting Hacked on Public Wi-Fi\nSure it's convenient to get online using the internet at your local coffee shop, but using public Wi-Fi is like living in a glass house with no locks on the doors. Not only are you at risk of having an unwanted audience, but people can stroll right in to steal your personal data, like passwords and photos. VPNHUB encrypts all of your communications over public Wi-Fi.\n\n* Privacy Protection and Location Masking\nYour ISP may keep logs of every website you visit. Other VPNs may do it too. VPNHUB does not, end of story! It’s like wherever you browse, we’re the forensic clean-up crew covering your tracks, and then we wipe our own memories too. And not only your browsing, but we’ll mask your true location by routing your data through our full stack of encrypted global servers.  \n\n* Servers in 60+ Locations\nStandard users get unlimited access to our United States servers. That’s a decent place to start, but why stay put in one spot? Go further. Go global. Go Premium, and get access to servers from over 60 countries in far-flung lands, like from Austria to Australia, from Malaysia to Mexico, or the UK to the UAE, and beyond.\n\nVPNHUB Premium Subscription Details:\n- 7 day free trial offer is commitment free, can be cancelled anytime.\n- Payments charged to user's iTunes Account upon purchase.\n- Subscription lengths and prices: one month ($15.99), one year (89.88).\n- Auto-renewal unless cancelled 24 hours prior to subscription ending.\n- Subscriptions may be managed or cancelled through the user's Account Settings.\n- No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during an active subscription period.\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.appatomic.net/privacy_policy.php\nTerms: https://www.appatomic.net/tos.php", "bundleId":"com.appatomic.vpnhub", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "formattedPrice":"Free"},

"description":"Private Internet Access VPN\n\nProtect your privacy with Private Internet Access®, the world's leading VPN service for iOS users on iPhone and iPad. Private Internet Access®, or PIA, enables users to encrypt their network traffic and stay protected when online with our proxy servers. Add privacy and security to private and public networks when you browse the Internet and use WiFi, whether connected to a hotspot or at home. High speeds, unlimited bandwidth, connect with 5 devices simultaneously (smartphones, tablets, computers), no traffic logs, and 24/7 professional, native English speaking customer support.\n\nWHY USE VPN FROM PRIVATE INTERNET ACCESS®?\n\n• Low price. $3.33 per month if you purchase a yearly account ($39.99/year) or $6.99 on a monthly basis.\n• Reliable and trusted VPN provider since 2010 with a proven no log policy.\n• Privacy is our Policy. Here at PIA, we not only provide a great VPN service at a low price, but we also support organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, FightForTheFuture, Creative Commons, Open Rights Group, Index on Censorship, freenode, Wireguard, Arch Linux, and many others.\n\nWe respect your privacy and anonymity.\n\nBY USING VPN FROM PRIVATE INTERNET ACCESS®, YOU GET:\n\n• IP Cloaking. Your IP address will be changed to a Private Internet Access IP address to hide your identity and location. Hide your IP address to stop data trackers, snoopers, and hackers from tracking your browsing and search activity.\n\n• Data Encryption. Encrypt your internet traffic with our VPN proxy. Our trusted online privacy service creates several security layers which keep you anonymous and prevent access to your data. It’s time to change your WiFi habits. Don’t use WiFi without our secure VPN to proxy your internet traffic!\nWiFi Security. With WPA and WPA2 now kracked, you need a VPN to protect your WiFi everywhere - not just in hotspots, coffee shops, cafes, hotels, and airports. If you use WiFi hotspots without encryption, your data can be seen, blocked, throttled, censored, or otherwise changed.\n\n• Content Blocker. The Safari Content Blocker blocks ads, trackers, and malware while browsing with Safari.\n\nWHAT DO OUR CUSTOMERS THINK?\n\n“Firstly, the company is second to none in terms of support, troubleshooting, and individualized assistance. Their nodes and hubs are top speed. Their client is streamlined and has a tremendous ease of use.”\nJAYDLUV, 10/10/2017\n\n“This is my go to app for VPN. Been using Windows version for years and the iPad version is great.”\nPkcarreon, 09/18/2017\n\n“No hiccups, no crashes or anything. It just works great. Bear in mind you have to subscribe to the service for this to work. I highly recommend it.”\nScott Loflin, 09/15/2017\n\n“Simple and solid. No issues even when traveling.”\nJoe1134206, 09/8/2017\n\n“Love it. Feel safer when browsing the internet.”\nCachuco, 08/7/2017\n\n“Hard to find a nit with this app. (...) The iOS app allows a quicker toggle on/off than digging into settings, for VPN hostile iOS apps like Pandora and Netflix. I like PIA’s value for the money, and I have not had any trouble whatsoever with the iOS app. I recommend this app, and PIA, as one of your layers of online security.”\nDB Associates, 01/27/2017\n\n“I did my homework, reviewing many VPN services. PIA was among the most economical, plenty of simultaneous connections and more than enough servers and services. (...) The speed is more than I hoped for. I can stream all YouTube videos. HD quality is superb with no buffering. I am happy to have this extra security on all our devices. My wife could not tell the difference after I installed it on her PC. I think I paid $39.99/year. What a bargain!”\nHelmut, 06/20/2016\n\nGDPR compatibility\n\nThis application only sends username and encrypted passwords to our servers as part of using this app. During signups, we also collect user's email. We do not collect and/or store any other user information.", "bundleId":"com.privateinternetaccess.ios.PIA-VPN", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "formattedPrice":"Free"},

"description":"Everything on your iPhone or iPad uses the internet. Your email apps, web browsers, photo apps, banking apps, chat and social apps. \n\nHaving secure internet access is critical and wifi routers are hacked every day. VPN Freely will encrypt your internet traffic preventing WiFi hackers from collecting data mid-stream. It can also help you access sites that may otherwise be blocked.\n\nVPN Freely is the easiest way to secure your iPhone/iPad wifi & cellular internet activity.

While connected you can safely surf the web, shop online and use banking apps without worry.\n\nStay Connected. Stay Safe.\n\nWhat's so great about VPN Freely?\n\n- Free iOS VPN for iPhone and iPad\n- Stealth Mode **NEW**\n- WiFi Hotspot Security\n- One Click Instant Access to Connect (No Sign-Up Required)\n- No Email, Names or Phone Numbers Required\n- 256 bit Bank Grade VPN Server Encryption\n- No Server Logs or Activity Tracking\n- We never sell user data. None of it.

However, just because your phone wants to connect to a WiFi hotspot doesn't mean it's safe. The fact is your phone can't tell you if the hotspot is safe or not. \n\nIf the hotspot is not secure other people online may be able to see your internet activity. Hackers love to sniff data on coffee shop WiFi networks because the customers feel comfortable there just like it's home. If the customer is comfortable they'll do things like personal banking online. This is why no public WiFi connection should be trusted.\n\nThe Solution = VPN Freely\n\nIt's so easy! One simple rule...\n\nAfter connecting to a Public WiFi Hotspot. Always, open your iPhone VPN Freely app (or iPad) and click \"Secure Me\". \n\nJust like that your internet access is encrypted and secured. It really is easy to surf the web safely. \n\nDownload VPN Freely today! \n\nDon't forget to try our Premium iOS VPN upgrade for free!\n\nWebsite: http://vpnfreely.com\nPrivacy Policy:  http://vpnfreely.com/privacy\nTerms of Service:  http://vpnfreely.com/terms\n\nNeed help?

"description":"F-Secure FREEDOME VPN: Protect your privacy. Change virtual location. Try now.\n\nStarting from £5.49 a month.\n\nFREEDOME VPN is a new kind of online privacy app. Surf carefree on public Wi-Fi without exposing yourself to hackers or advertisers. Change your virtual location for extra privacy. \n\n• VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK: With a VPN, your actual IP address is hidden from the services you visit. Not even your internet service provider can see what you do online. We do not log your traffic. \n\n• WI-FI SECURITY: Even on unsecured public Wi Fi, your traffic is encrypted and impossible to intercept. \n\n• SURF SAFE AND UNTRACKED: FREEDOME blocks unwanted third-party tracking and malicious sites. This will also stop advertisers from making money at the expense of your privacy.\n\n• NO LIMITS: Unlimited bandwidth. No traffic logs. \n\nHighly rated by magazines\n\nWired: “The good news is that CSIRO researchers did find some gems. They specifically lauded F-Secure Freedome, an app that encrypts what it says it will.” - February 8th 2017\n\nArsTechnica: “Those relying on an app that isn't Freedome should consider dumping it or at least suspending use of it until they have reviewed the app's performance.” – January 28th 2017\n\nPCWorld: “Freedome VPN pledges not to log your traffic and is run by F-Secure, an established and reputable name in Internet security.” – March 29th 2017\n\n\n\nSUBSCRIPTION OPTIONS \n\nF-Secure FREEDOME VPN is free to download and use for 5 days. It’s quick to install – no registrations or settings required.\n\nOne subscription covers all your iOS devices with the same Apple ID.\n\nFREEDOME is also available as part of F-Secure TOTAL.\n\nNOTE: Your subscription automatically renews unless the subscription is canceled at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. The payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at the purchase confirmation. Your iTunes account will be automatically charged at the same price for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period unless you cancel your subscription at ‘Manage subscriptions’ under ‘Settings’. No cancellation of the current subscription is possible during active subscription period. Any unused portion of a free trial period, will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription. \n\n\nWE LOVE TO HEAR FROM OUR USERS\n\nF-Secure FREEDOME is ready to use, but it doesn't mean we're done improving it on it. We want to make it even better and are really eager to hear from our users. \n\nTwitter: @FreedomeVPN.\n\nFor frequently asked questions, please visit our community pages: \nhttps://community.f-secure.com/\n\nF-Secure Privacy Policy: \nhttps://www.f-secure.com/en/web/legal/privacy/freedome \n\nF-Secure Terms of Use: \nhttp://www.f-secure.com/en/web/home_global/license-terms", "bundleId":"com.f-secure.freedome", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "formattedPrice":"Free"},

"description":"Hi VPN is the top secure and unlimited VPN (Virtual Private Network) proxy for your devices. Hi VPN masks your IP address, encrypts your Internet traffic, protects your privacy with a secure connection on public Wi-Fi so that you can access any content safely and anonymously.\n\nWhy Choose Hi VPN?\n\n• Hi VPN is extremely fast, and especially secure.\n• Large number of servers covering all around the world.\n• All-new designed app with an unprecedented smooth experience.\n• Intelligently choose the fastest and highest quality server.\n• Hi VPN has no limit on traffic and usage time at all.\n• No need to register or login, no account required.\n• No tracking of your network access, no log storage.\n• No additional permissions required.\n• Hi VPN works with Wi-Fi, LTE, 3G, and all mobile cellular data carriers.\n\nInstall Hi VPN Now You Can:\n\n► Stay anonymous online and protect privacy\n\nUsing Hi VPN, your IP and location will be masked and your activities can no longer be tracked on the Internet. Hi VPN is fully committed to your Internet privacy and keeps no logs of your activity, even if someone requests the data of our VPN service users, we have none to provide.\n\n► Secure your device and your mobile data\n\nHi VPN secures your device’s connection while you’re connected to public Wi-Fi hotspots or cellular data networks. Your password and your personal data are secured and you are protected from hacker attacks.\n\n► Obtain largest range of country and region coverage\n\nHi VPN offers tens of thousands of servers in dozens of countries including the United States, Canada, Brazil, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, India and more, which gives you more choices and better connection speeds.\n\n► Use unlimited VPN, forever\n\nAs we promise, Hi VPN always keep unlimited, and will continue forever. (Free VPN version may show some ads. Upgrade to Hi VPN Premium to enjoy ad-free VPN, if you prefer.)\n\nWhat is a VPN and Why Would I Need One?\n\nA VPN, or Virtual Private Network, allows you to create a secure connection to another network over the Internet. VPNs can be used to shield your browsing activity from prying eyes on public Wi-Fi, and more.\n\nIn very simple terms, a VPN connects your PC, smartphone, or tablet to another computer (called a server) somewhere on the internet, and allows you to browse the internet using that computer’s internet connection. So if that server is in a different country, it will appear as if you are coming from that country, and you can potentially access things that you couldn’t normally.\n\nThe vast majority of people these days are using VPN. They are still very useful for protecting yourself while working at a coffee shop, but that’s hardly the primary use anymore.\n\nHi VPN Premium service includes:\n\n• 3-day free trial: free of charge; no commitment; cancel anytime.\n• Price of subscription: one-year plan: $3.99/mo; 6-month plan: $5.33/mo; monthly plan: $7.99/mo.\n• Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n• Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n• Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal.\n• Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.\n• Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nTerms of Use: http://bit.ly/HiVPNTerms\nPrivacy Policy: http://bit.ly/HiVPNPrivacy\n\nCopyright © 2019 Hi Security Lab.

"description":"ProtonVPN’s mission is to make advanced online privacy and security available to everyone. With ProtonVPN, you can:\n- Protect your privacy by hiding your IP address\n- Browse the web securely (even on public WiFi)\n- Visit blocked/censored websites\n\nProtonVPN is a community-supported VPN developed by the same team of scientists that created ProtonMail, the world’s largest encrypted email service. ProtonVPN has a free plan so anybody can use it. You can upgrade to a paid plan to unlock all features.\n\n\nWhy ProtonVPN?\n\n- NO LOGS. EVER\nProtonVPN is a no logs VPN service. We do not track or record your Internet activity, and therefore, cannot disclose this information to third parties.\n\n- STRONG ENCRYPTION\nOur VPN app for iOS uses the IKEv2 protocol. We use only the highest-strength encryption to protect your Internet connection. This means all your network traffic is encrypted with AES-256 and uses 2048-bit RSA key exchange.\n\n- PERFECT FORWARD SECRECY\nProtonVPN uses ciphers with Perfect Forward Secrecy, meaning your encrypted traffic cannot be captured and decrypted later, even if an encryption key gets compromised in the future.\n\n- SWISS BASED\nProtonVPN is a Swiss company, which means you are protected by some of the strongest privacy regulations in the world. \n\n- TRUSTED\nUnlike other VPN services, we provide full transparency so you know who is running the service. Whether it is challenging governments, educating the public, or training journalists, we are well known for fighting for privacy online and contributing to the open source community.\n\n- FREE\nProtonVPN is the ONLY free VPN service that has no privacy invading ads, no malware, no bandwidth limits, and does not secretly sell user data. The free service is supported by optional paid plans that come with more servers and more features.\n\n\nPaid ProtonVPN plans come with additional features, such as:\n\n- HIGH SPEED GLOBAL NETWORK\nProtonVPN has hundreds of servers located all around the world, accessible via a single click. All servers are on high speed 1 Gbit or 10 Gbit connections. Free users can only access slower servers in 3 countries.\n\n- SECURE CORE VPN\nRegular VPN services can be compromised if their servers are under surveillance. ProtonVPN prevents this by first passing user traffic through our Secure Core network in privacy-friendly countries like Switzerland and Iceland. Thus, even a compromised VPN endpoint server will not reveal your true IP address. Secure Core is available for ProtonVPN Plus & ProtonVPN Visionary users.\n\n- TOR VPN\nProtonVPN Plus & ProtonVPN Visionary include Tor support. With a single click, you can route all your traffic through the Tor network and access Onion sites.\n\n\nWhat the world is saying about ProtonVPN\n\n\" It’s worth noting here that ProtonVPN’s free service doesn’t implement data limitations or other caps, as some providers do\" -- VentureBeat\n\n\" ProtonVPN looks to have an admirable goal of bringing an open, private internet to all. \" -- CNET\n\n\" The service, developed by MIT and CERN, promises to route all traffic through privacy-friendly countries ... a great option for those who are looking for a secure VPN option, developed by reputable people.\" --LifeHacker\n\n\nReady to secure your mobile Internet? Get ProtonVPN for free and stay protected.", "bundleId":"ch.protonmail.vpn", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "formattedPrice":"Free"},

With the additional \"save scan\" feature you can save performed scans, name them and display them later for comparisons.\n\nIf you want to know what's going on in you computer network - iNet is for you.\n\nP.s.: iNet is the little brother of iNet Pro. This free version of iNet offers the same sophisticated network scan engine as the Pro version.
