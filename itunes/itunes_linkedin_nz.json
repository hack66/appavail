It not only helps users to convert their visiting cards & biz cards into e business cards using OCR but also lets them export their e business card data to their devices.\n\n- Networking: Eight stands out among others as it not only scans your business cards but also lets you stay linked in with your contacts who are themselves Eight users, by providing options such as private instant chat messaging and an activity feed thus providing you with ample business opportunities and timely updates from your network.\n\nHow does Eight compare to alternatives?\nCamcard: Camcard and most other scanners only uses OCR, not human input, causing significantly lower accuracy.\nBric: Bric and others have scan limits, following which you have to pay. Eight is totally free and unlimited.", "currency":"NZD", "bundleId":"net.8card.eight", 
"releaseNotes":"For everyone using Eight Premium, we're pleased to announce a new feature:\n\n-  You can now add photos in the notes section.\n\nWhether its a whiteboard captured from a meeting, or slides used in a seminar, you can add those photos to one of your contacts. Now you can recall the moment of exchanging business cards, visually!\n\nMore updates to come soon. Thanks for using Eight!", "releaseDate":"2011-06-18T01:56:13Z", "primaryGenreName":"Business", "primaryGenreId":6000, "minimumOsVersion":"10.0"},

"description":"Your network is one of your most valuable assets. At its full potential, it can unlock a whole world of opportunities. But if you’re like most people, building, maintaining, and getting value from your networks is hard. You are surrounded by opportunities: but to capture them, you need a way to see them. Kalido works constantly to help you uncover opportunities to use your skills; find people who have skills you need; and expand your network in ways that create value for you and the people you add.\n\nThis empowers you to offer skills and services, find skilled professionals and meet potential clients, with trust at the core of every interaction. Simply by responding to two simple prompts “I want to meet…” and “I can provide…” and sharing your contacts, you unleash the power of Kalido to find unique and trusted matches for you.\n\nKalido drives incredible networking value for enterprises, schools, conference organisers and attendees.  For enterprises: Kalido enables better onboarding for new joiners (including temporary hires like freelancers and consultants). For schools, Kalido allows alumni to stay connected wherever they are in the world, hire each other more easily, and get introductions and referrals to trusted and skilled people through a community they trust. For conference organisers, attendees find live networking opportunities through immediate matching and browsing, so they can meet, converse and exchange value in minutes.  For everyone else, Kalido removes the middleman, and replaces anonymous reviews with trusted recommendations.\n\nKalido acts as your marketplace for people.  It will find you an awesome local web designer, it will allow you to introduce your friend, who is a freelance photographer, to your private trusted network of local entrepreneurs. It will allow you to make money from your hobby and introduce you to people looking for your skills. Kalido will tell you when a friend or colleague is nearby so you can catch up for that overdue coffee which may lead to a big career opportunity you hadn’t even thought of. It will do all of this, perpetually, infinitely, daily. For free.\n\nWe believe that there should be a level playing field and people should have the environment to create opportunity for themselves no matter who they are.  That’s why we built Kalido.\n\n● Nearby: You are surrounded by talented individuals who can offer useful skills, and Kalido can help you discover them. More importantly, it can help you be discovered too, maybe for local jobs or freelance opportunities. No matter where you are in the world Kalido will tell you who’s around.\n\n● Networks: Join networks to see and match with relevant people nearby, wherever you are in the world. Search and share opportunities with fellow alumni and colleagues. Meet up, chat with, and get introductions to new business clients, professionals, or other alumni. Create your own customised and secure private network and invite colleagues and friends to join.\n\n● Introductions: Do you have a connection who needs to hire a photographer for an upcoming project? Perhaps your friend is a freelance photographer? Why not introduce them to each other online? Kalido gives you the ability to refer and be referred because everybody knows someone.\n\n● Chat: Call, text, or meet up with your matches and trusted contacts directly. Use pre-defined icebreakers to help you get things off the ground and network.\n\n● Trusted matches: we match you with the right people, enabling freelancers to meet new clients, start networking, outsource and succeed in their career. We prioritize matches who have shared contacts, shared networks and are nearby.\n\n● Offer freelancing services: we provide business and job opportunities to freelancers and small businesses to offer their services. Freelancers can meet professional clients who value their work and get jobs at a fair price. Kalido will be your online cv to showcase your skills and experience.", "currency":"NZD", "bundleId":"net.ommobile.samui", 
"releaseNotes":"• In order to improve security and address user feedback, Kalido no longer automatically adds users as your contacts based on phone book data\n• Now you’ll see a “My Personal Network” network, which lets you individually manage your personal connections by sending and accepting requests\n• When expanding your personal network, you can now search for anyone in your existing networks, and anyone else who has chosen to be findable on Kalido, and request to add them. Once you’ve made a request, and the other person has accepted, they will be part of your personal network\n• In Settings, you can manage your search visibility, to choose whether anyone can find you, or only people in your networks\n• We have replaced the default public environment that all users previously belonged to with a set of geographic networks: These networks are automatically created for countries, cities, and neighbourhoods where Kalido users are active. Anyone can join these networks, allowing everyone an easy way to understand the communities around them. For companies and schools, this also means that during onboarding, a user can choose to join only your private network, creating the option of a completely private Kalido experience for them from Day One\n• Private network admins can now specify an email domain (e.g. my company.com) that will allow anyone with an @mycompany.com email address to automatically join a specific private network\n• When signing up, in addition to adding any custom skill you want, we’ve made it easier to select skills you have, and skills you are looking for, from a curated list\n• When signing up,  we now suggest people that you might know, to make building your personal network easier\n• To improve navigation, the bottom tab bar is now visible at all times, unless you are in an uninterruptible flow (e.g. when recommending someone, introducing someone, or adding a skill, search or interest to your profile). This means you can now navigate into a screen within the Networks tab, and still have one-tap access to the Nearby tab, for example.\n• Our matching AI has learned to be better and faster, so now you'll get higher quality matches in less time across a broader set of skill concepts\n• Improved performance for chat, matching, network, and nearby views, making it easier to interact with networks that have thousands of members\n• More than 100 small bug fixes and minor experience improvements across the board", "releaseDate":"2015-10-29T14:19:21Z", "primaryGenreName":"Business", "primaryGenreId":6000, "minimumOsVersion":"10.0"},

"description":"Salut, your new business card is ready! \n\nMore than 88% of business cards are thrown out one week after they’re exchanged. Approximately 100 billion cards are printed globally each year, consuming 6 million trees. That’s about the equivalent of San Francisco in forest area that is cut each year, just to make business cards that are thrown out.\n\nSalut will help you go completely paper-less and digitize your business cards. You can easily create a card in less than five minutes and include all relevant business information like email, LinkedIn profile, Instagram page, website and much more. \n\nYou can then share this card with anyone, using a QR code or email invite. The receiver does not need to have Salut installed, instead they can view your Salut card as an email or web version on any device. \n\nFinally, you can keep track of all your contacts inside the app. Contacts are updated in real time so if somebody changes their phone number, it will also be updated in your app. \n\n\n***What people say about Salut***\n\n\"Since we have sustainability deeply incorporated in our core values, we've decided not to use business cards in our company anymore. Therefore, Salut solution helps me in many ways in my business life. It allows me to manage all my contacts from fairs, business meetings and everyday life at one place. Moreover, it's time and cost saving - we don't need to design and print business cards over and over again.\"\n\n- Dominika Osvaldova @ SmartHead", "currency":"NZD", "bundleId":"com.TN.Salut.Prod", "releaseNotes":"Salut!

"description":"SparksFly™ simplifies and unifies the repeated steps you take participating in all your social feeds. One app, one screen lets you view and post all user-content regardless of what social media platform is it on. You gain “intelligent control” over searching, sorting and curating all of your feeds - control to know something before others do, to know more than others do - control to be more well-informed all from what is already flowing through your social mobile apps. SparksFly™ brings people, brands, ideas and relevant real-time information closer together than ever before. \n\nSparksFly™ Patent-pending Artificial Intelligence \nWe took another GIANT leap forward in the evolution of social media by applying our multi-patent-pending AI Engine to all the content across your selected social networks within the SparksFly™ app. Our engine “discovers and surfaces” uniquely relevant pieces of content, facts, trends, places, people, topics and ideas, “Sparks”, that would have been impossible to discover on your own culling through thousands of posts across multiple social networks in real time. The more our AI engine learns about what you do, like and dislike in your feeds, the brighter and more frequent the “Sparks” fly. Sparks come from from the collection of content flowing through ALL of your feeds together NOT Twitter, or Facebook, or Instagram, etc. separately. \n\nSparksFly’s™ single screen and individualized AI engine enable anyone who uses more than one social network to keep up with ALL content and get ahead of its collective meaning. It's a MUST HAVE for those who use social to be in-the-know or want to be one of the first-to-know without the massive time commitment required today. \n\nSocial simplified. It's about time.\n\nGet the App Now!", "currency":"NZD", "bundleId":"com.sparksfly.iphone", "releaseNotes":"Updated some API's.

You could end Autoplay mode by tapping anywhere on the screen. You could also change the time interval for Autoplay from the Settings page. Autoplay can be used at the same time as VoiceOver.\n\n- Background and text design customization\n\nSwipe to the right to go to the Design Settings page. You could change background image and text design to your liking. Go ahead and look for your favorite combination of background, text color, and text shadow color. \nTip: It tends to look good if you choose the same color for both text color and text shadow color.\nText size can be changed from the Settings page.\n\n- VoiceOver\n\nUnlike any other quotes app, we have VoiceOver function (reading the quotes out loud). This feature is compatible in Japanese and English.\nPlease do understand that it may sound mechanical at times. You could change the overall tone of the voice from the Settings page.\n\n- Regular notification\n\nGo to Settings -> xxx time -> \"choose message\" to register a message from your favorites list as a notification message. Use this to remind and motivate yourself each day.\n\n- BGM\n\nHow about reading inspirational quotes while listening to calm, natural background music? You can choose from three types of sounds from the nature from the Settings page. You could use this to relax before going to bed.\n\n- Snow animation\n\nAs a small gift to users, we prepared a snow animation. Go to the Settings page and turn the feature on, go back to the Quotes page, and let the sakura fall gently down your screen. True, it might block your view a little. But I think it is sometimes nice to feel the nature while reading inspirational quotes. \n\n- Share with friends\n\nTap the arrow icon on the Quotes page, to show a selection of media to share. Currently we have twitter, facebook and LINE. \nYou could also save the image to your camera roll. Turn on your friend's \"switch\" by sharing your favorite quote. \n\n- Finally\n\nThere are more features than what we have explained above, and we are certain that this app will satisfy any quote lover.\nWe are also doing regular updates to accommodate to the latest OS and features. Please try this app out and see how you like it.", "currency":"NZD", "bundleId":"com.chocofactory.BusinesSwitch", "releaseNotes":"・bug fix", "releaseDate":"2014-02-04T08:00:00Z", "primaryGenreName":"Business", "primaryGenreId":6000, "minimumOsVersion":"8.4"},

"description":"[ Storyline ]\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a... No, no, no, this is not a any fairytale, this is true story of alien invasion to the earth. Huge among of alien troops attacks to earth planet and your goal is to guide and lead United Alliance to victorious battle and wipe out aliens out of galaxy. Aliens have conquered galaxies and planets one by one, but now it's time to stop them finally, before their actually reach our precious tellus planet.\nPeople in earth are huge danger, alien troops have big technology advantage and huge waves of soldiers. Aliens are also really nasty creatures, their have big teeth and poison tentacles. Only good strategy and great logical moves can save our planet middle on this invasion. You can start to strike back one wave at a time and try to kill as many enemies as possible with a single move, you don't have afford any mistakes.

Alien queen can birth alien eggs really fast and they grow to adults quite short time period, so their number is growing rapidly. Aliens are from Sirius Nebula and they conquered lots of planets. Their technology is a few hundred a year ahead of us and they have already developed teleportation. Luckily our latest laser weapons can destroy their star ships and blow their slime bodies away.\nAliens started their journey couple hundred years ago and started to conquer the universe. They have been victorious when they travelled around universe and their number has grown to billions. They seem to think that there is no race that can fight back and they are superior race in the Universe. Maybe this is their only weakness.\n\n[ How to play ]\n\nYou control your strikes by selecting alien or group of aliens by your finger. This will destroy aliens which are connected together with a telepathic link. Alien telepathic link is connected when aliens touching others horizontally or vertically and their are coloured with a same colour. There are six different coloured alien orcs (red, blue, green, yellow, purple and oranges). So you have to plan your strikes well so you could make huge link between aliens. You have two rounds to make a strike before new wave is coming closer. If aliens reach the earth, it's end of mankind living on globe. You really need to grow your experience and intelligence to finally reach the victory of the battle.\n\nAre you ready on this battle and rescue world nations globally and protect our beautiful planet. Last man standing!\n\n[ Identity Orcs ]\nRed Orc is Lurker Soldier which trying to sneak attack you from behind\nBlue Orc is Warrior which attack with using terrific force and can reap you to pieces\nGreen Orc is Mind Reader which scan your brain with a telepathic means\nYellow Orc is War Lord, which burn his enemies with a flame thrower\nPurble Orc is War Captain and using his poison tentacles and recover really fast\nOrange Orc is Technology Wizard, which is responsible for equipment functionality and can reset earth defence system and weapons.\n\n[ Alliance Forces ]\nYou are the commander of the United Alliance and lead the army. Battalions equipped with the latest weapons technology.\n\n[ Features ]\n- Hiscore tables (best scores, killed green orcs, killed blue orcs, killed red orcs, killed yellow orcs, killed purple orcs and killed orange orcs)\n- Logical puzzle (this is almost like a one man chess game)\n- Easy controls\n- Easy gameplay\n- Hours of fun\n- Highly fun and addictive game\n- Easy to play anywhere and anytime\n- Automaticly save game state", "currency":"NZD", "bundleId":"com.ccbrothers.EarthInvasion", "releaseDate":"2015-02-12T08:00:00Z", "primaryGenreName":"Games", "primaryGenreId":6014, "minimumOsVersion":"5.1.1"},

Now you can either create a job, or post your availability - much better.\n\nYou can now filter jobs by location and category, making it easier to find exactly what you’re looking for\n\nWe’ve added social links to your portfolio. Head over to your profile and press edit to add your social links.\n\nGet notified when someone applies for your job. No more checking ‘My Jobs’ every 10 minutes.\n\nOther UI changes to make everything look and run nicer.\n\nEnjoy :)", "releaseDate":"2015-09-08T07:00:00Z", "primaryGenreName":"Business", "primaryGenreId":6000, "minimumOsVersion":"7.0"},
