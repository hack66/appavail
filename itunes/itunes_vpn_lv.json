     'VPN + TOR is the only app featuring both a VPN and a TOR browser. VPN + TOR is the most secure and advanced browser that allows you to choose between the speed and ease of use of VPNs tunnel connection and the advanced protection offered by the TOR network.\n \nAre you sure none is spying on you? Nowadays, anonymous surfing on the web is increasingly important in order to protect your personal data 360 degrees. This is valid not only when you browse incognito from a laptop, but also when you use your iPhone and you want to shield your private informations. The TOR (The Onion Router) Network protects you by bouncing your communications around a distributed network of relays run by volunteers all around the world: it prevents somebody watching your Internet connection from learning what sites you visit, and it prevents the sites you visit from learning your physical location.

It makes public Wi-Fi safe and secure, and also keeps your browsing private from ISPs.

Anytime, anywhere.\nGrizzly-grade security: TunnelBear uses strong AES-256 bit encryption by default. Weaker encryption isn’t even an option.\nNo logging. Your browsing stays private.\nHelpful support that always responds within 24 hours.\n\nWHAT CRITICS ARE SAYING\n“TunnelBear is an elegant, easy mobile VPN that keeps you safe.”\n- Lifehacker\n\n“The app is bursting with charm, but it also delivers security at a good price.”\n- PCMag\n\n“All you have to do is turn the switch to “ON” and you are protected.”\n- WSJ\n\n“TunnelBear, the gorgeous VPN app that wants to bring online privacy to everyone.”\n- VentureBeat\n\nPRIVACY POLICY:\n*Spoiler alert* TunnelBear has a strict no-logging policy. You can read our entire plain-english privacy policy here: https://www.tunnelbear.com/privacy-policy\n\nCONTACT US:\nIs your TunnelBear misbehaving? Do you have feedback for us?

     '+++300MB VPN data for FREE!+++Best Online Game Accelerator+++Access VOIP & Facebook, YouTube, Hulu, Skype, Instagram, SnapChat, Netflix smoothly!+++Auto-setup all your devices (iPhone, iPad, iTouch)+++Servers in United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, France, Hong Kong and Germany!\n\nWHAT IS IT?\nVPN is a 128-bit encrypted tunnel between your device (computer, iPhone/iTouch/iPad) and one of our servers.\n\nWHY HAVE A VPN ACCOUNT?\nIf you want a total Internet traffic anonymizing experience, a VPN account is the best way to go - there’s no IP numbers to configure into the webapps, and no software to install - just set up the VPN and it’s done! Other features include, but are not limited to:\n\n- Use VOIP service from anywhere\n- Accelerate online games: get extremely low latency when playing Order & Chaos, MetalStorm online and etc.\n- Assigns your computer a new IP address, hides your real IP to anonymize all web applications.\n- A secure encrypted connection between your computer and the Internet.\n- Secure your wireless (Wi-Fi) connection at home or at public Hotspots.\n- Unlike a proxy, you get secured connection for all programs you are using, (e.g ICQ, Email, FTP, News and anything that uses a Internet Connection)\n\nWHY USE VPN EXPRESS FOR YOUR VPN SERVICES?\n- Support All VPN Protocols available in iOS devices: IPSec, L2TP over IPSec and PPTP!\n- Lowest Rates with 24x7 availability! 99% service up time!

VPN Express does exactly what, when, & how I need it for a very reasonable price. Best one out there!"\n\n+++++ Jan 22, 2012 by Neil.D\n"100% Perfect. 100% of the Time - This is the best VPN solution I have used. It\'s on my Mac, iPad and iPhone and can be used simultaneously! The pricing plans are awesome as well. Saves me a bundle."\n\n+++++ Jan 11, 2012 by Anthony Martinez\n"Simple, efficient VPN. It just works. - Very easy to use with auto-configure setting. I use this all the time, and find it is great when traveling internationally or when I want greater wifi security in coffee shops. Recommended."\n\n+++++ Oct 17, 2011 by Computer Bear\n"VPN Express - This app is great. Skype was blocked at the hospital where my son was in the NICU. My family and friends could not always travel the 150 mile round trip with us to see the baby. The hospitals IT director was asked to unblock Skype several times. He would not. With this app I went around the firewall. I highly recommend this app."',

These sites usually have checks to verify your identity using your common locations. If you suddenly appear as logging in from another country, you may get blocked. You must also be careful to ensure proper HTTPS is used to prevent someone from seeing your password. It\'s best to simply avoid these sites to be safe. - Google search will sometimes present a CAPTCHA while using Orxy. If it persists, use another anonymous friendly search engine such as http://ddg.gg (or http://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion)',

     'VPNHUB protects your online privacy and masks your IP. With thousands of servers in over 60 countries, our VPN lets you access sites and streaming from anywhere on the planet, without losing one second of browsing speed. It’s an armored car with a supersonic jet engine.\n\nThe reality today is that the internet is full of restrictions, censorship, privacy invasions, security breaches, and a host of unwanted entities trafficking in your personal data. What a downer!\n\nVPNHUB is your first-class ticket to that original ideal of a truly secure and private internet. It is the most powerful, most reliable and most secure VPN service in existence. Right on!\n\nYou can try VPNHUB right now, without even needing to register! Go ahead and kiss the following problems goodbye, like that time you…\n\n… once bought a tent online and got bombarded with camping equipment ads, or\n… wanted to access news from your home country while abroad but got blocked, or\n… were denied banking assistance because you once visited some online gambling sites, or\n… had your personal data stolen because you used the Wi-Fi at your local café, etc.\n\nVPNHUB is the total solution to all of the above problems and more!\n\nStandard Features:\n* American VPN Servers\n* Military-Grade Encryption\n* Hide Your IP and Location\n* Bypass Censorship\n* Access Public Wi-Fi Securely\n\nVPNHUB Premium includes:\n* Global Video Streaming\n* Servers in 60+ Locations\n* Apps for Desktop \n* Multiple Devices At Once\n* Top Speeds & Zero Data Caps\n\n* Unblock Global Video Streaming\nWatch TV, movies and live sports from any country no matter where you are. VPNHUB spoofs your IP, letting you connect from the VPN server of your choice. Forget angry border guards, VPNHUB is your diplomatic immunity to the world’s most popular sites. \n\n* Bye Bye Censorship\nWith censorship and information control on the rise, the internet can seem like a dark place. VPNHUB transforms the internet into a tool of liberation!\n \n* Avoid Getting Hacked on Public Wi-Fi\nSure it\'s convenient to get online using the internet at your local coffee shop, but using public Wi-Fi is like living in a glass house with no locks on the doors. Not only are you at risk of having an unwanted audience, but people can stroll right in to steal your personal data, like passwords and photos. VPNHUB encrypts all of your communications over public Wi-Fi.\n\n* Privacy Protection and Location Masking\nYour ISP may keep logs of every website you visit. Other VPNs may do it too. VPNHUB does not, end of story! It’s like wherever you browse, we’re the forensic clean-up crew covering your tracks, and then we wipe our own memories too. And not only your browsing, but we’ll mask your true location by routing your data through our full stack of encrypted global servers.  \n\n* Servers in 60+ Locations\nStandard users get unlimited access to our United States servers. That’s a decent place to start, but why stay put in one spot? Go further. Go global. Go Premium, and get access to servers from over 60 countries in far-flung lands, like from Austria to Australia, from Malaysia to Mexico, or the UK to the UAE, and beyond.\n\nVPNHUB Premium Subscription Details:\n- 7 day free trial offer is commitment free, can be cancelled anytime.\n- Payments charged to user\'s iTunes Account upon purchase.\n- Subscription lengths and prices: one month ($15.99), one year (89.88).\n- Auto-renewal unless cancelled 24 hours prior to subscription ending.\n- Subscriptions may be managed or cancelled through the user\'s Account Settings.\n- No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during an active subscription period.\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.appatomic.net/privacy_policy.php\nTerms: https://www.appatomic.net/tos.php',

    description:
     'Your big screen on your pocket screen. Anywhere.\n\nRemote Desktop allows you to connect to any Windows computer using your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad. The app uses Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to connect to any Windows that has support for Terminal Services.\n\nFEATURES: \n\n* It is an universal app so you only have to purchase the full version once and then use it on all your devices.\n\n* perfect for low speed connections. When you\'re on a slow speed network choose "Low quality images" and 640x480 resolution. This minimizes the required bandwith.\n\n* emulates the mouse. You can left-click, right-click and even double click. Drag & drop is also implemented.\n\n* zoom and pan the remote desktop screen as in the Safari browser.\n\n* Safari-like page view for switching between multiple concurrent sessions\n\n* connect to any version of Windows starting with XP, except all Home and Starter versions. From all these editions Microsoft removed the Terminal Services.\n\n* uses the bigger screen size of iPhone 5\n\nQUICK START GUIDE:\n\nTo start using Remote Desktop tap "Add PC" from the bottom toolbar. Add a name for the entry, the hostname (or IP address), your username and password and choose the image quality and resolution. Tap Save when you\'re done.\n\nIn the main screen you will see the new entry. Tap on it to connect, swipe it to delete it or tap the disclosure icon to edit the computer\'s informations.\n\nOn slow network connections choose low image quality and a low resolution to insure proper screen updates. Also be aware that iPod Touches tend to work slow when choosing higher image resolutions.\n\nBUY ONCE, USE IT ON ALL YOUR DEVICES:\n\nThe app is free so you can download it and test it with your PCs configuration without having to pay in advance. If it works with your configuration (routers, firewalls, etc) then you can disable the ads by purchasing an in-app product that costs 0.99$. The app in it\'s free version is a fully functional app, so you can test every option before deciding to buy.\n\nAfter purchasing the in-app feature on one device, you can disable the banners on all your devices (iPads, iPhones, iPod Touches) without having to pay again, as long as you use the same iTunes account. To do this you have to go through the purchase process on each additional device. Hit \'Disable Ads\', confirm the purchase and a message from iTunes will confirm you already bought the product and the banners will be disabled.\n\n************************** \nIf the ads are shown again after a reinstall go through the purchase process again to remove them. You won\'t be charged again. This only re-activates the in-app product on the device.\n**************************\n\nVERSION HISTORY: \n\nVersion 1.1:\n* added a new scissor icon in the upper toolbar when a connection is open and active. When touched it brings up a set of text edit commands: CTRL+C (Copy), CTRL+X (Cut), CTRL+V (Paste), CTRL+Z(Undo), CTRL+F (Find), CTRL+R (Replace). \n\n* added a new setting to the connection settings: Use Console. Enable this switch if you want to connect to the console session. \n\nVersion 1.2:\n* updated the screen size to take advantage of the larger screen of iPhone 5\n\n***********************************\nPlease read our Support section at \nhttp://rdp.bamtoo.com/support/ \nor email us if you can\'t connect to your PC. And make sure you activated Remote Desktop Services in your Windows system, you connect to your external IP address and you forwarded calls to RDP port if you use a wireless router in your home.\n***********************************',

     'Brave Web Browser is a faster, free, secure web browser for iOS with a built-in AdBlocker that prevents tracking and provides security protection, and optimized data and battery experience.\n\nADBLOCKING\nBrave adblocker browser is designed with a built-in Ad Block to provide an ad-free and seamless browsing experience.\n\nFAST & SECURE\nNo external plugins or settings to manage or configure! Brave simply provides the fastest and most secure browsing experience available for iOS. Brave is designed for both speed and security, so you can enjoy lightning fast browsing without popups, malware and other annoyances.\n\nBATTERY & DATA OPTIMIZATION\nBrave reduces page loading time, improves performance, and guards from ads infected with malware. Brave shows a 2x to 8x speed increase on iOS, so you will see a direct reduction in both battery and data plan consumption.\n\nPRIVACY PROTECTION\nThe Brave privacy browser also protects users with leading privacy and security features such as HTTPS Everywhere (encrypted data traffic), script blocking, cookie blocking, and private incognito tabs. Others, including Firefox, Opera, Chrome, Aloha, Ghostery and the Dolphin browsers, fall short of the level of privacy and security protection that Brave provides. \n\nBrave for iOS has the following features:\n* Built-in Ad-Block\n* Pop-up blocker\n* Saves data, Saves money\n* Battery optimization\n* Data optimization\n* Tracking Protection\n* Https Everywhere (for security)\n* Script Blocking\n* Bookmarks \n* History\n* Private tabs\n* Recent tabs\n\nHow to get started? \nEasy! Just click on the lion head and discover Brave Shields, which have per-site settings so you can decide which sites to block.\n\nAbout Brave\nWe have a mission to save the web by increasing browsing speed and safety for users, while growing ad revenue share for content creators.\n\nThe web has become a different place. With the ad-tech ecosystem out of control, users have revolted and blocking ads has become the new weapon of choice for improving their browsing speed, safety and privacy. Unfortunately, blocking alone results in a race to the bottom where nobody wins. Without the ability for content creators to earn money for their efforts, users could be left with fewer sites to browse, relegated to hand-picked content from controlled sources.\n\nBrave aims to transform the online ad ecosystem with micropayments and a new revenue-sharing solution to give users and publishers a better deal, where fast, safe browsing is the path to a brighter future for the open web.\n\nTo learn more about Brave web browser which has a built-in AdBlocker, tracking and security protection, and optimized data and battery experience, please go to https://www.brave.com\n\nSupport: If you have any questions or recommendations, please feel free to reach out to us at community.brave.com',

    releaseNotes:
     'Hello all you wonderful people, here’s a little update with some little fixes and a big Shields feature.\n\nHere’s what we updated:\n\n- Cookie Control is back! You can now block all cookies. This was one of the things we had to basically rebuild from scratch when we switched browser engines to WKWebView back in December. So it’s all very new and shiny and modern and new we would appreciate it if you didn’t scratch the paintwork. \n- Bookmarks are easier to use. \n- Everyone hates it when Brave crashes, so we made that happen less. It’s more complicated than it sounds.\n- iPads are supposed to look big and beautiful, but we weren’t looking as beautiful as we wanted. A little UI self-care and we’re pretty as ever.\n- Our translations needed a whole lot of love. Now they only need a lot of love. We’re trying, we promise!\n\nAs ever, thanks for using Brave. If you’ve got any questions or comments, check out https://community.brave.com, or you can reach us directly at http://brave.com/msupport or support+ios@brave.com where we 100% guarantee that an actual human person will definitely read your email.',

     'IntelliVPN is a VPN service that uses the IPSec / IKEv2 protocol and bank-level encryption. VPN service provides encryption of traffic, which ensures the security of the data you transmit through public networks, such as public Wi-Fi.\n\nIntelliVPN gives you access to VPN servers in over 20+ regions around the world.\n\nYour provider cannot track or restrict your online activity.  All resources you visit (websites, social media, etc.) will see IP addresses of our VPN servers instead of your IP.\n\nWhy IntelliVPN?\n\na. Bank-level encryption (AES-256)\n\nIntelliVPN uses a 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm that ensures your personal data protection. It is impossible to tap your data; hackers or fraudsters have no chance to access it. It is of primary importance when using public Wi-Fi access points in airports and metro, cafes and restaurants, hotels and malls or in other potentially dangerous networks.\n\nb. Absolute anonymity in the Internet\n\nIntelliVPN hides your actions and location from service providers, website administrators, search engines, and fraudsters. All of them see the IP-address of our server instead of your personal one. That makes it impossible to detect your actual location and name of your Internet provider based on IP.\n\nc. No restrictions\n\nIntelliVPN has no restrictions on the speed or volume of transmitted data. Communicate in social networks, listen to music and watch films and series without being concerned about Internet traffic.\n\nd. Access to Tor network\n\nIntelliVPN provides access to Tor network and transparent access to .onion sites without the need for the use of specialised browsers.\n\n=== Premium ===\n\nTo gain access to an extended list of ultra fast servers and priority technical support, you can subscribe to the Premium version.\nPremium available via auto-renewable subscription.
