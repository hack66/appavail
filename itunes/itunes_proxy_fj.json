With this app I went around the firewall. I highly recommend this app.\"", "bundleId":"com.bestsparks.vpnclient", "trackId":375584677, "releaseNotes":"Bug fixes", "releaseDate":"2012-06-02T22:43:34Z", "primaryGenreName":"Productivity", "primaryGenreId":6007},

"releaseNotes":"* A smart user’s guide to online security: enable VPN auto-connect and forget about. Yes, you read it right – the AUTO-CONNECT feature is here! Make it work for you: \n   - keep VPN on at all times; \n   - connect to VPN only on Wi-Fi; \n   - or, enable VPN only on networks you don’t trust. \nSo yeah, simply flip a switch, and NordVPN will take it from there. Easy!\n\n* Where did the Kill Switch toggle go? No need to worry: from now on, Kill Switch always runs in the background silently. If your VPN connection drops for a second or two, Kill Switch will disable the internet until the connection to a VPN server is restored. This way, hackers won’t get a chance to sniff on your data, not even for a brief moment.\n\n* Shortcuts to your recent connections are now accessible from the NordVPN widget. Now that’s a tap-saver!", "releaseDate":"2014-12-09T07:24:51Z", "primaryGenreName":"Productivity", "primaryGenreId":6007},

Touch VPN – the unlimited VPN – is the solution for you!\n\n***** Highlights of Touch VPN *****\n\n-- Free (with Ads):  To remove ads, you can choose monthly or yearly subscription.\n\n-- Unlimited: Truly unlimited.

When connecting to a VPN server through Touch VPN for example - it sets up a secured and encrypted connection to an external server. Because of the encryption process, the data cannot be filtered.\n\nWhy using a VPN: With a VPN, your online privacy and security will be greatly bolstered as you’ll be surfing the web protected.\n\nVPN vs. Proxy: VPN and Proxy can both conceal user identity through re-routing your internet traffic. A Proxy server is, however, completely browser-based, and might not be compatible with certain web pages that use non-browser technology. Unlike a Proxy, a VPN service encrypts all your traffic and will work with all internet based services. In summary, VPN will provide you with more online privacy and security.\n\nWith Touch VPN you can：\n\n* When you’re connected to a public Wi-Fi Hotspot, your name, passwords, and personal information can be easily compromised. Touch VPN encrypts your data and provides you with banking-level security for the best protection. \n\n* Touch VPN is a one-click VPN Proxy Service. Touch VPN contains only one button. The button connects you to one of many servers at speeds faster than a web proxy. When you are not running our app we help you save your device's battery.\n\n* Surf the Web Privately.  Your real IP address is concealed and your internet activity is inaccessible to prying eyes and businesses.\n\n--------------\n\nSubscription:\n\nYou can be an Elite user through auto-renewable subscription. Choose between monthly and yearly plans and enjoy VPN with no Ads from virtual location of your choice.\n\n– Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n– Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n– Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal\n– Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n– Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nLegal:\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.northghost.com/privacy\nTerms of Service: https://www.northghost.com/terms", "bundleId":"com.northghost.touchvpnios", "trackId":991744383,

"description":"Everything on your iPhone or iPad uses the internet. Your email apps, web browsers, photo apps, banking apps, chat and social apps. \n\nHaving secure internet access is critical and wifi routers are hacked every day. VPN Freely will encrypt your internet traffic preventing WiFi hackers from collecting data mid-stream. It can also help you access sites that may otherwise be blocked.\n\nVPN Freely is the easiest way to secure your iPhone/iPad wifi & cellular internet activity. By simply clicking the \"Secure Me\" button you will be connected to our ultra secure Virtual Private Network. While connected you can safely surf the web, shop online and use banking apps without worry.\n\nStay Connected. Stay Safe.\n\nWhat's so great about VPN Freely?\n\n- Free iOS VPN for iPhone and iPad\n- Stealth Mode **NEW**\n- WiFi Hotspot Security\n- One Click Instant Access to Connect (No Sign-Up Required)\n- No Email, Names or Phone Numbers Required\n- 256 bit Bank Grade VPN Server Encryption\n- No Server Logs or Activity Tracking\n- We never sell user data. None of it. Ever.\n- Your internet traffic will travel over our secure IP similar to a Proxy\n- Encrypt the internet connection to your web browsers and mobile apps\n- No daily limits on usage\n- No data limits on streaming and downloads\n- Built on servers trusted by millions\n- Double the speed of your Free account by subscribing to our Newsletter\n\nAbout our Premium iOS VPN Service Subscriptions:\n\n- Go Premium to remove your speed limits and stop ads\n- Go Premium to remove the 30min session timeout \n- Go Premium to use Stealth Mode\n- Premium subscriptions are tied to your Apple ID. You can use one subscription on up to 5 devices as long as they're using the same Apple ID. After you go Premium simply use the \"Restore Purchase\" option on your additional devices (using the same Apple ID) to make them Premium also.\n- We do offer Free Trials of the Premium version from time to time. These are offered to Free users via popup message in the app.\n- At the end of your trial the auto-renew subscription for Monthly Premium VPN service will start\n- Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n- Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\n- Subscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase\n- Any unused portion of a free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a Premium subscription\n\nNow for a lesson in security.\n\nWhat is \"WiFi Hotspot Security\" anyway?\n\nWiFi is everywhere now and if we can save our cellular data even just a little bit, we want to connect. However, just because your phone wants to connect to a WiFi hotspot doesn't mean it's safe. The fact is your phone can't tell you if the hotspot is safe or not. \n\nIf the hotspot is not secure other people online may be able to see your internet activity. Hackers love to sniff data on coffee shop WiFi networks because the customers feel comfortable there just like it's home. If the customer is comfortable they'll do things like personal banking online. This is why no public WiFi connection should be trusted.\n\nThe Solution = VPN Freely\n\nIt's so easy! One simple rule...\n\nAfter connecting to a Public WiFi Hotspot. Always, open your iPhone VPN Freely app (or iPad) and click \"Secure Me\". \n\nJust like that your internet access is encrypted and secured. It really is easy to surf the web safely. \n\nDownload VPN Freely today! \n\nDon't forget to try our Premium iOS VPN upgrade for free!\n\nWebsite: http://vpnfreely.com\nPrivacy Policy:  http://vpnfreely.com/privacy\nTerms of Service:  http://vpnfreely.com/terms\n\nNeed help?

Upgrade to Hi VPN Premium to enjoy ad-free VPN, if you prefer.)\n\nWhat is a VPN and Why Would I Need One?\n\nA VPN, or Virtual Private Network, allows you to create a secure connection to another network over the Internet. VPNs can be used to shield your browsing activity from prying eyes on public Wi-Fi, and more.\n\nIn very simple terms, a VPN connects your PC, smartphone, or tablet to another computer (called a server) somewhere on the internet, and allows you to browse the internet using that computer’s internet connection. So if that server is in a different country, it will appear as if you are coming from that country, and you can potentially access things that you couldn’t normally.\n\nThe vast majority of people these days are using VPN. They are still very useful for protecting yourself while working at a coffee shop, but that’s hardly the primary use anymore.\n\nHi VPN Premium service includes:\n\n• 3-day free trial: free of charge; no commitment; cancel anytime.\n• Price of subscription: one-year plan: $3.99/mo; 6-month plan: $5.33/mo; monthly plan: $7.99/mo.\n• Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n• Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n• Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period, and identify the cost of the renewal.\n• Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.\n• Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.\n\nTerms of Use: http://bit.ly/HiVPNTerms\nPrivacy Policy: http://bit.ly/HiVPNPrivacy\n\nCopyright © 2019 Hi Security Lab.

"description":"F-Secure FREEDOME VPN: Protect your privacy. Change virtual location. Try now.\n\nStarting from £5.49 a month.\n\nFREEDOME VPN is a new kind of online privacy app. Surf carefree on public Wi-Fi without exposing yourself to hackers or advertisers. Change your virtual location for extra privacy. \n\n• VIRTUAL PRIVATE NETWORK: With a VPN, your actual IP address is hidden from the services you visit. Not even your internet service provider can see what you do online. We do not log your traffic. \n\n• WI-FI SECURITY: Even on unsecured public Wi Fi, your traffic is encrypted and impossible to intercept. \n\n• SURF SAFE AND UNTRACKED: FREEDOME blocks unwanted third-party tracking and malicious sites. This will also stop advertisers from making money at the expense of your privacy.\n\n• NO LIMITS: Unlimited bandwidth. No traffic logs. \n\nHighly rated by magazines\n\nWired: “The good news is that CSIRO researchers did find some gems. They specifically lauded F-Secure Freedome, an app that encrypts what it says it will.” - February 8th 2017\n\nArsTechnica: “Those relying on an app that isn't Freedome should consider dumping it or at least suspending use of it until they have reviewed the app's performance.” – January 28th 2017\n\nPCWorld: “Freedome VPN pledges not to log your traffic and is run by F-Secure, an established and reputable name in Internet security.” – March 29th 2017\n\n\n\nSUBSCRIPTION OPTIONS \n\nF-Secure FREEDOME VPN is free to download and use for 5 days. It’s quick to install – no registrations or settings required.\n\nOne subscription covers all your iOS devices with the same Apple ID.\n\nFREEDOME is also available as part of F-Secure TOTAL.\n\nNOTE: Your subscription automatically renews unless the subscription is canceled at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. The payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at the purchase confirmation. Your iTunes account will be automatically charged at the same price for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period unless you cancel your subscription at ‘Manage subscriptions’ under ‘Settings’. No cancellation of the current subscription is possible during active subscription period. Any unused portion of a free trial period, will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription. \n\n\nWE LOVE TO HEAR FROM OUR USERS\n\nF-Secure FREEDOME is ready to use, but it doesn't mean we're done improving it on it.

With WPA and WPA2 now kracked, you need a VPN to protect your WiFi everywhere - not just in hotspots, coffee shops, cafes, hotels, and airports. If you use WiFi hotspots without encryption, your data can be seen, blocked, throttled, censored, or otherwise changed.\n\n• Content Blocker.

No issues even when traveling.”\nJoe1134206, 09/8/2017\n\n“Love it. Feel safer when browsing the internet.”\nCachuco, 08/7/2017\n\n“Hard to find a nit with this app. (...) The iOS app allows a quicker toggle on/off than digging into settings, for VPN hostile iOS apps like Pandora and Netflix. I like PIA’s value for the money, and I have not had any trouble whatsoever with the iOS app. I recommend this app, and PIA, as one of your layers of online security.”\nDB Associates, 01/27/2017\n\n“I did my homework, reviewing many VPN services. PIA was among the most economical, plenty of simultaneous connections and more than enough servers and services. (...) The speed is more than I hoped for. I can stream all YouTube videos. HD quality is superb with no buffering. I am happy to have this extra security on all our devices. My wife could not tell the difference after I installed it on her PC. I think I paid $39.99/year. What a bargain!”\nHelmut, 06/20/2016\n\nGDPR compatibility\n\nThis application only sends username and encrypted passwords to our servers as part of using this app. During signups, we also collect user's email.

"description":"• #1 ad blocking solution for iOS\n• Over 750 000 app downloads worldwide\n• No in-app purchases, no subscription. Simple one-time payment\n• Top Utility ranked in all App Stores around the world \n• Over 1000+ carefully crafted filters\n• Easy setup in under 1 minute with detailed tutorial\n• Now with built-in Safari Content Blocker for better web ad protection\n\nWeblock allows you to control how your device fetches online content. Easily manage PAC (Proxy Auto-Config) script and route different connections through different proxy servers. Weblock can make your device download ads (banners and popups), stats and user tracking, scripts or images through a proxy server you pick. It also allows you to use a different proxy for specific websites, like Facebook, Twitter, Google+, social widgets from websites. You can even define your own content filters. With Weblock you can control proxy for basically any network resource! This way you can choose not to reveal your real IP to different services, limit advanced ad targeting and protect your privacy.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICE: You're responsible for selecting a proxy server that allows you to download content you wish to download. We DO NOT provide a proxy service. Using a bad proxy server (like 127.0.0.1:8021) might result in some resources being blocked. You can control your proxy settings selectively with Weblock. Contact our support if you need help choosing right proxy server or setting up Weblock on your device.\n\nHere are some situations in which Weblock might come in handy:\n• Fetch ads through a proxy server you choose. Protect your privacy and prevent ad servers from knowing your real IP address and tracking you.\n• Disable majority of ads on websites you visit on your iOS device! Weblock supports all major web browsers: Safari, Chrome, Mercury and others (browsers redirecting web traffic through third-party servers like Puffin Browser or Opera Mini are not be supported).\n• Easily remove all native Facebook widgets and plugins (Like buttons, comments, etc.) on sites you visit - simply disable Facebook plugins in Weblock! Do the same for Twitter, Google+ and other social media.\n• Stop annoying Tapatalk popups, nagging you to download forum browsing app on every visit.\n• Take control of someone else's device - you can preconfigure any iOS device to control it with your Weblock app. Block or redirect any content, anytime, directly from your own device.\n• Your predefined filters and custom rules can be synced between all your iOS devices using iCloud.\n• If you wish to block something else, you can create your own rules and filters. You can block any URL (with regular expressions), domain or IP address. Don't know how? Let us know - we're here for you.\n• You can also use Weblock's redirect feature to emulate '/etc/hosts' entries for HTTP and HTTPS traffic. This might be useful for web and app developers to pin domains to different IP addresses.\n\n••• IMPORTANT! •••\nNeed help setting up Weblock?

"description":"Proxy connects you to your friends nearby. Whether you’re traveling on the other side of the world, hanging on the other side of town, or chilling at home, Proxy shows you who of your friends are nearby right now. Share what you are doing and see what friends are up to with status messages. Start a conversation on Proxy and meet up in person.\n\nProxy shares your proximity with friends nearby, not your exact location, so friends will only see that you’re “<1 mi” or “5 mi” away, not that you’re at Magic: The Gathering store (unless you say so in your status). \n\nProxy currently uses Facebook to connect you to your nearby friends. It will provide alternative onboarding methods such as phone contacts in the future, but Proxy currently requires Facebook.\n\n*** We have shutdown the Proxy server to focus on other projects (see Whammy in the App Store). Thanks to those of you that used Play. If you really want Play to come back, send us a message at info@joinproxy.com ***\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Proximity: Proxy doesn’t share your exact location with anyone, only your proximity (e.g. 5 miles) with friends who are nearby.\n\n* Status: Share what you are doing with friends nearby and see what they’re up to with status messages.\n\n* Messaging: Quickly connect with friends nearby via text messages.\n\n* Context: Status messages and conversations are in the moment and will clear as your context (location and time) changes.\n\n* Ghost Mode and blocking: Easily block individual users or switch into Ghost Mode to temporarily stop sharing your proximity with all users.\n\n* Privacy: Proxy doesn’t store your past locations, statuses, or conversations. \n\n* Low energy footprint: Proxy doesn't constantly update your location in the background so it will not negatively affect your battery charge.\n\n\nWhy use Proxy:\n\n* “In the present”: While most social apps remove you from your present situations, Proxy is entirely focused on here and now. “Spend less time looking at your friends’ photos and more time in them.”\n\n* “In the know”: While most social apps keep you in the know about news or cute animal videos that your friends like, Proxy keeps you in the know about what your friends are up to right now in your proximity.\n\n* “In the proxy”: Proxy turns your immediate proximity into a constant party.

"description":"IntelliVPN is a VPN service that uses the IPSec / IKEv2 protocol and bank-level encryption. VPN service provides encryption of traffic, which ensures the security of the data you transmit through public networks, such as public Wi-Fi.\n\nIntelliVPN gives you access to VPN servers in over 20+ regions around the world.\n\nYour provider cannot track or restrict your online activity.  All resources you visit (websites, social media, etc.) will see IP addresses of our VPN servers instead of your IP.\n\nWhy IntelliVPN?\n\na. Bank-level encryption (AES-256)\n\nIntelliVPN uses a 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm that ensures your personal data protection. It is impossible to tap your data; hackers or fraudsters have no chance to access it. It is of primary importance when using public Wi-Fi access points in airports and metro, cafes and restaurants, hotels and malls or in other potentially dangerous networks.\n\nb. Absolute anonymity in the Internet\n\nIntelliVPN hides your actions and location from service providers, website administrators, search engines, and fraudsters. All of them see the IP-address of our server instead of your personal one. That makes it impossible to detect your actual location and name of your Internet provider based on IP.\n\nc. No restrictions\n\nIntelliVPN has no restrictions on the speed or volume of transmitted data. Communicate in social networks, listen to music and watch films and series without being concerned about Internet traffic.\n\nd. Access to Tor network\n\nIntelliVPN provides access to Tor network and transparent access to .onion sites without the need for the use of specialised browsers.\n\n=== Premium ===\n\nTo gain access to an extended list of ultra fast servers and priority technical support, you can subscribe to the Premium version.\nPremium available via auto-renewable subscription. We offer following subscription options:\n\n- One month for $4.99\n- One year for $44.99\n\nAll subscription options include 3-days trial period\n\n=== Subscription details ===\n\nA subscription will renew at the end of each month unless cancelled.\n\n- Payments will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase.\n- An account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours priority to end of current period.\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.\n- No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during an active subscription period.\n\n=== Feedback ===\n\nIf you have comments or questions about IntelliVPN, please send them to us at support@intellivpn.net.\n\nWe are also on Twitter: @IntelliVPN\n\nOur privacy policy: https://intellivpn.net/privacy_privacy.html\nTerms of service: https://intellivpn.net/terms_of_service.html", "bundleId":"net.intellivpn.ios", "trackId":1083416533, "releaseNotes":"In this release, we fixed a few bugs and improved the connection stability.", "releaseDate":"2016-03-22T03:31:55Z", "primaryGenreName":"Productivity", "primaryGenreId":6007},

"description":"Nowadays, Privacy is a Luxury!\nWhenever we pay our bills, manage our bank accounts, or log in to our favorite social networks, our credentials, account numbers, billing address, and other private data may end up in the crosshairs of identity thieves.\nTrust your security and privacy to professionals!\n\nWEB PRIVACY\nKeep your internet activities anonymous and untraceable wherever you are. Zero-log policy, traffic encryption, IP and DNS masking. These all mean that third parties are not able to monitor you any longer, and that your privacy is reliably secured from obtrusive website and ISP surveillance.\n\n+70 LOCATIONS\nOur high-speed VPN servers in 70+ locations all over the globe, as well as our enhanced KeepSolid Wise technology, allow you to freely surf the web without giving out a single piece of your personal information, including your current location. Don’t let websites discriminate you based on the way you surf the internet or the place you browse it from.\n\nTOTAL SECURITY\nWe offers a variety of VPN protocols, each with unique capabilities and strengths. Just choose the one you would like to try. For instance:\nOpenVPN - an extremely secure and highly configurable protocol that uses a wide range of encryption algorithms (including AES-256).\nIKEv2 - a secure and easy-to-setup protocol that can effectively change networks and re-establish VPN connection if it was temporarily lost. It provides a significantly higher connection speed and a better performance.\n\nWe offer three recurring subscription options: \n- 1 Month, 3 months, 1 Year\n- Subscriptions will auto-renew unless canceled.\n- Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase.\n- No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period.\n- Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.\n- Your account will be charged for renewal for the amount of your current subscription within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period.
