"description":"Signal Generator is an app that produces audio test tones. The basic app produces sine waves, and it can be extended and customized (via in-app purchases) to produce white noise, pink noise, frequency sweeps, and (on iPhone 4 and better) square waves, sawtooth waves, and triangle waves.\n\n• Tone Generator. The basic app includes a sine wave generator that generates signals from 20 Hz to 20 kHz, with a 44.1 kHz sample rate, 16-bit samples, and 96 dB of dynamic range. Frequency control via logarithmic knob or keyboard input.\n\n• Pro Tone Generator. (Optional in-app purchase). Extends the frequency range down to 1 Hz, and adds stereo control and buttons to increment the frequency in steps. On iPhone 4 and better, alias-reduced classic waveforms are available. Square waves, sawtooth waves, and triangle waves are generated with aliasing kept to -54 dB or less. \n\n• Noise Generator. (Optional in-app purchase). Produces white noise, pink noise, and brown noise. Pink noise falls off at 3 dB per octave (±1 dB). Brown noise falls off at 6 dB per octave.\n\n• Frequency Sweeps. (Optional in-app purchase). Adjustable start and stop frequencies. Linear or logarithmic sine wave frequency sweeps. Single shot sweeps, repeating upward sweeps, and upward/downward sweeps.\n\nThis app can be used to:\n\n• Test Speakers and Headphones\n• Balance your Home Theater System\n• Tune Your Car Audio System\n• Mask Environmental Noise\n• Burn In Headphones\n• Tune Musical Instruments", "bundleId":"net.mpunk.signal", "trackId":543661843, "sellerName":"Media Punk Studios LLC", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true},

"description":"OpenSignal is the ultimate signal toolkit that shows you how to get a better network connection instantly, find nearby free Wifi hotspots worldwide, view signal maps so that you can compare performance of networks in your area and test the speed of your mobile or Wifi connection. \n\nUnlike other apps, which look for maximum possible speed through optimized testing, OpenSignal informs you about your true speed - what you are likely to experience when normally using your phone. Anyone using the app contributes data, informing others about real-world, not estimated, mobile performance (and we'll never ask you for personal information, just your signal strength stats).\n\nWith OpenSignal you can map cellular coverage, find Wi-Fi hotspots, test and improve your reception & get faster data.\n\n- Signal compass points you in the direction your signal is coming from \n- Speed test for download, upload and latency\n- Map of cell towers and Wifi hotspots\n- Coverage maps allow you see the best/worst places for 2G, 3G and 4G \n- Free and ad-free\n\nBased on our community-generated data we are able to help keep you better connected by giving you a practical solution to the problems of slow mobile internet. Simply follow our signal compass to walk towards better phone signal or see our in-app copoverage maps to work out which carrier is best for where you are, useful if you're thinking about switching networks. Our wifi maps help you find local public-access wireless networks (Wifi hotspots).\n\nMaps are not updated in real-time. Don’t worry though, we log the information you share with us to improve our coverage maps and performance information. We’re working hard to make sure the data you contribute to the project is available to everyone as quickly as possible. \n\nTips:\n- Not all towers and wireless hotspots are in our database - we’re working on it!\n- Moving in the direction of your cell tower (the signal compass) will not always improve reception due to interference effects/local geography\n- Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nIf you read to here (!) you should really join the OpenSignal beta to help us improve the app, just email hi@opensignal.com if you're interested.", "bundleId":"com.opensignal.OpenSignalMaps", "trackId":598298030, "sellerName":"OpenSignal Inc.", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "averageUserRating":1.5, "userRatingCount":5},

"description":"Confide is your confidential messenger.

More control.\n• Unlimited attachments\n• Retract (\"un-send\") an unread message\n• Nicknames\n• Themes\n• Priority customer support\n\nConfide has been used in over 180 countries and has been featured in Fortune, Forbes, Bloomberg, NYT, WSJ, Washington Post and more.\n\nConfide allows you to communicate digitally with the same level of privacy and security as the spoken word.\n\nGet Confide and retake control of your digital conversations.\n\n———\n\nScreenShield is a new technology that is only supported when the message recipient is using a recent version of Confide.

It’s completely frictionless – there’s no need to create an account. Due to technical limitations of iMessage, Confide for iMessage does not offer the same level of screenshot protection as the main version of Confide.\n\n———\n\nPrice may vary by location.

"description":"SPL Meter is a professional-grade sound level meter, also known as a decibel or dB meter, for your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nModeled after a traditional analog SPL meter, we have faithfully reproduced all the characteristics and qualities found in those meters, including the ballistics, ranges, filters, and decay rates.\n\nUnder the hood we have advanced DSP-based algorithms that meet or exceed ANSI / IEC Type 1 standards. And starting with iOS 6, we can disable the mic filters and limiters, to get the real world performance of a hand-held SPL meter.\n\nAnd now, upgrade SPL Meter with iTestMic, our pro-grade test & measurement mic, made specifically for iOS devices. Using iTestMic with SPL Meter, you get a calibrated, accurate SPL Meter, that meets industry standards for Type 2 performance. See our website for more information.\n\nBut don't compare us to a Radio Shack meter, ours is much more accurate! \n\nWe have also included a digital LCD display, as shown in the image, to make this the best SPL meter available for iPhone or iPad. And this is something that the old analog meters never had! \n\nThe screen will flip when you flip the phone over, so that you can point the iPhone mic directly at the sound source. (iPhone X does not support upside down mode)\n\nSPL Meter is a universal app -- buy once, and use on all of your iOS devices.\n\nSPL Meter is built by the same team that created the other great professional audio and acoustics apps on the store, Studio Six Digital.  Built on the engine of our more expensive \"SPL\" app, SPL Meter's filters and decay rates meet or exceed ANSI type 1. This app is not a toy or a game.\n\nSPL Meter is the one audio app that everyone who works in audio must have on their phone! Not only have we made the best one, but we've priced it so you can't afford not to get it.\n\n*** FEATURES:\n\nFILTERS -- A and C weighting filters are provided.\n\nDECAY -- Choose ANSI Fast or Slow.\n\nRANGES -- 40dB to 120dB in 9 ranges.\n\nCALIBRATION -- Comes pre-calibrated for the typical iPhone or iPad built-in and headset mic, but you can adjust the calibration if you have a professional, calibrated meter to compare it to. Accesses our cloud-based iOS device calibration database, which we updates as new devices are released.\n\nINTERNAL / EXTERNAL MIC -- Select Internal to activate the included compensation filter, which is designed to flatten the frequency response of the built-in or headset mic. External will work with our iPhone Measurement Mic, to be released later this summer. See our website for more details.\n\nSPL Meter is bargain-priced to make it easy for anyone to check out one of our professional, accurate apps. Studio Six Digital is dedicated to making the iPhone and Touch a professional audio and acoustics test device.\n\nCheck out our full line of professional-grade audio and acoustics apps: SPL, the professional digital iPhone sound level meter, SPL Graph, for recording SPL over time, RTA, a 1/3 octave real-time analyzer,  FFT, for detailed acoustic analysis, ETC, the energy-time curve function, RT60, for automated octave-band decay time measurement, Speaker Pop, to test speaker polarity, and Generator, the iPhone signal generator.\n\nAlso, if you are looking for more great acoustical and audio test apps, have a look at AudioTools, our premier app for audio professionals.", "bundleId":"com.studiosix.SPLMeter", "trackId":309206756, "sellerName":"Andrew Smith", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true},

"description":"Signal Flags is an authority for identification, interpretation and use of signal flags between ships. This comprehensive app is your resource for signal flag information as specified by the International Code of Signals, the U.S. Navy, the International Sailing Federation, NATO, and Allied Forces around the world. Everything you need to know or want to know is in here.\n\n“I am a blue water sailor, cruising the East Coast of the U.S. and out to Bermuda. This app [contains] a copy of H.O. Pub 102 which is carried on the signal bridge of every commercial ship in the world. As the code meanings are uniform regardless of the nationality of the ship involved, a Portugese fisherman can use the code to request medical advice from the doctor onboard a Norwegian cruise ship even though neither speaks the other's language. Naturally, the paper copy is easier to use, but this is great in a pinch, and is a good study tool...”\n- GHK3\n\nIt's a beautiful day as you cruise the harbor in your new boat. The smell of sea water and being captain of your own vessel is pretty heady. Taking in the view, you notice a Naval ship flying unusual flags in the area you’re heading for. There’s an “A” flag, followed by a number 3 flag. You know that seafaring vessels have special signals but you don’t know what they mean. Whipping out your Signal Flags app, you quickly scroll, tapping the appropriate flags to discover that you must avoid the ship within 300 yards as they have divers in the water. You adjust your course a little to comply. Thank goodness you were able to find out before you intruded on the ship’s operation.\n\nSignal Flags have been used for communication between ships at sea since ancient times. They have evolved throughout history and now are uniformly mandated by the International Code of Signals. The flags remove the language barrier by indicating with symbols, many types of distress and information to all U.S. and Allied Forces around the globe. They are used by government, military and civilians traveling the world’s waterways.\n\nThe app contains all of the images, flags and pennants that you’ll need to know, along with detailed descriptions of their usage and meanings in international, military, and sail racing contexts. You don’t need a cumbersome book; you don’t even need an internet connection. Just pull out your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch and open Signal Flags. All the important information is contained right there in the application. Within a few seconds, you’ll know what that ship is telling you.\n\nIn addition to the signal details, this app supplies you with the complete documentation of the NIMA pub. 102 and the U.S. Department of Transportation/U.S. Coast Guard Navigation Rules (COMDTINST M16672.2D).  Both documents include extensive in-document hyperlinks for accessibility along with a specialized toolbar for quick and simple browsing.  A specialized quiz function is also provided to aid in memorization of the entire flag set. \n\n\u2028Features:\n\n* Designed and developed by a U.S. Naval Academy graduate\n* Needs no network connection once downloaded\n* Contains all current signal flag details\n* Contains complete documentation as laid out by governing sources\n* Includes a quiz function to help you memorize all the flags\n\nIf you spend time on the open water, are the employee of an organization that navigates the seas, a yacht racer, or an interested student, this application is an indispensable tool. Everything is here for you, at your fingertips, anytime, anywhere.

"description":"ABOUT THIS COURSE\n\nThis course introduces signal processing tools currently used in geophysics. It has been elaborated both from the book \"Signal processing for geologists and geophysicists\" (J.L. Mari, F. Glangeaud, F. Coppens, 1999) and from the CD \"Signal processing in geosciences\" (F. Glangeaud ,J.L. Mari, 2000).\n\nFor signal processing specialists, it will be a source of how classical or new theories can be applied to field data.Teaching staff should find it provides a means of tackling the teaching signal processing techniques.\n\n- - -\n\nFOREWORD\n\nThis on line course presents a succession of lessons classed by theme. The different themes that are tackled are:\n\n• The Fourier Transformation\n• Common functions in spectral analysis\n• Sampling\n• Correlation\n• Wave separation\n• Seismic applications\n• The Hilbert transformation\n• Filtering\n• Near Surface Geophysics\n• Stochastic Signal Processing\n• Attributes\n\nEach theme has an introduction and a series of lessons which are associated with it. A lesson comprises of text, a video, a formulary, if judged necessary, and in some cases an applet to practice.\n\n• The text present has been voluntarily reduced; its objective is put across by the animation. This objective may be the presentation of a specific transform used in signal processing and applied in seismic processing. The term \"transform\" is used here in a very general sense. It covers at times the notion of transformation, such as the Fourier transformation or filters such as the Wiener filter. The objective perhaps being to show the application of a \"transform\" on simulated synthetic data or on real acquired geophysical data.\n\n• The video is an illustration of the text. It permits a visualization of the data, to study the influence of processing parameters on the data. The images were conceived in a manner which permits an immediate visual comparison and that enables an evaluation of the influence of a parameter change on the data processing. If an applet is associated with the video, some parameters can be modified by moving the cursors, the calculations taking place in real time.\n\n• The formulary gives the mathematical formula used in the animation. The reader is invited to use the book cited above as a reference for the notations used and the demonstrations. The formulary should be considered as a simple memory aid.\n\nThe videos and the applets have been created thanks to the MUSTIG software ( mustig.free.fr, Gérard Lejeune).\nIn this on line course, 20 lessons can be selected. For the animations based on field data measurement, the authors or organisms that provide with them are mentioned.\n\nThis on line course does not constitute a complete course in itself ; referral to the basic signal processing texts remains essential.\n\n- - -\n\nTHE AUTHOR\n\nJean-Luc Mari is at present a geophysics professor at IFP School and an IFPEN expert. He supervises the MSc research program in \"Lithosphere, Basins, Petroleum\" part of the Master's program in Science and Technology (Paris VI).\n\nJean-Luc Mari is a member of the European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers.\n\nJean-Luc Mari is author and co-author of patents (in the field of acoustic well logging), numerous scientific articles and books on geophysical methods and signal processing.\n\nHe has been involved in the design and development of specific teaching aids (on-line (http://www-ig.unil.ch/cours/) and CD-ROMs).\n\nHis main fields of expertise are seismic acquisition and processing, geophysics of reservoirs and civil engineering.", "bundleId":"com.odysys.signalprocessing", "trackId":509996063, "sellerName":"ODYSYS SARL", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true},

The International Morse Code encodes the Roman alphabet, the Arabic numerals and a small set of punctuation and procedural signals as standardized sequences of short and long signals called \"dots\" and \"dashes\" respectively, or \"dits\" and \"dahs\".\n\nMore information with Morse code translation table can be found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code", "bundleId":"sk.mediaware.morsecode", "trackId":464572501, "sellerName":"Pavel Kanzelsberger", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true},

"description":"A Real Time Analyzer for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. Test your speakers, tune your room, do acoustical analysis work or just have a better understanding of audio frequencies. RTA is a professional-grade acoustical analysis tool. All filters meet or exceed ANSI and IEC Class 1 specifications. \n\nIncludes Octave and 1/3 Octave modes, with selectable decay times, as well as Peak Hold and true linear Average mode.\n\n*** iOS Microphones\n\nWe have analyzied every iOS device, including all of the iPads, all iPhones, and iPod touches, and have created microphone compensation files that are applied automatically. You can trust the results you are getting, often within just a few dB of a far more expensive analyzer. Calibration is updated regularly, automatically, from our cloud-based calibration database.\n\nUpgrade to our iTestMic or iAudioInterface2 to bring your system up to full professional specs.\n\n*** Save and Recall Graphs\n\nYou can save and recall graphs, marked with the GPS location, date & time, and your comment, as well as store the image to your photo roll.\n\nExport the data as an XLS formatted file to your computer for inclusion in reports or further analysis.\n\n*** Max and Min Bars\n\nYou can also turn on resettable Max/Min bars (see image #4) to capture peaks. Double-tap to reset the bars.\n\n*** Specifications and Devices\n\nThe internal iPhone mic has a noise floor near 30 dB, and if your are running iOS 6, clips around 120 dB. \n\n*** Touch GUI\n\nFully interactive touch GUI features includes scroll up/down, pinch to zoom or compress the vertical dB scale, or swipe horizontally to get a cursor that reads out the exact dB level and frequency across the screen. To make the cursor disappear, swipe it off the graph to the left.\n\nThe landscape-mode display flips 180 degrees so that you can face the internal mic in either direction.\n\n*** Overlay Curves\n\nAlso included are optional noise curve overlays, in NCB, RC, PNC, NC, X-Curve and NR mode. See picture #2 for an example. Use this feature to get a quick reading on the noise levels in a room. Also includes the cinema large-room X-curve overlay.\n\n*** Calibration\n\nRTA can be fully calibrated, whether you are using it with the internal iOS microphone, or one of our professional test & measurement mic solutions. And, if you are using iTestMic, the mic calibration is transmitted directly to the app, so you are always calibrated.\n\n*** RTA or FFT?\n\nIf you are wondering if you should download this app or our FFT app, check out our website, we have a page devoted to this topic.\n\nSee our other acoustics and audio apps, including AudioTools.", "bundleId":"com.studiosix.RTA", "trackId":298839433, "sellerName":"Andrew Smith", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true},

"description":"Generate custom color noises including brown, pink, white, blue, and violet.  Customize noise further by using low and high cut filters. Simple modern interface remembers all settings for quick generation and utilizes advanced mathematical formulas to generate all audio waves.  There are no audio files included in the application binary which keeps app size to a minimum and app performance to a maximum.\n\nWhat are benefits of listening to white noise?\n- Helps you sleep by blocking distractions\n- Pacifies fussy and crying babies\n- Relaxes and reduces stress\n- Increases focus while enhancing privacy\n- Soothes headaches and migraines\n- Masks tinnitus (ringing of the ears)\n\nWhat are the different sound colors?\n- White noise sounds similar to static of an analog TV or radio station that has stopped broadcasting.   White noise has equal energy across all sound frequencies.\n- Brown noise sounds like a powerful waterfall.  It has more energy at the lower frequencies and if you have a good speaker system with a subwoofer you should be able to really feel it.\n- Pink noise's upper sound frequencies don't fall off as fast as they do with brown noise, so you'll get a little more punch. The most interesting thing about pink noise is it's found in almost all electronic devices (known as flicker noise) and even in biological systems.\n- Blue and violet noise are the opposites of pink and brown noise, respectively, and sound like spraying water from a garden hose. It has more energy at the higher frequencies which means more treble and less bass. \n- Curious to learn more about color noises?  Check out this article for all the details:  http://www.tmsoft.com/white-noise-player/\n\nDirections:\nDrag the Sound Color slider to select brown, pink, white, blue, violet, or somewhere in-between.  Next, drag the low and high cut filters to further customize to your liking.  Adjust device volume using the on-screen volume slider to a comfortable level.  You can also specify to play audio to any AirPlay supported device.  Toggle audio playback using the Play/Pause button.\n\nCreated by the audio experts at TMSOFT that brought you the famous White Noise app.  Check out all our apps and sounds at http://www.tmsoft.com/", "bundleId":"com.tmsoft.NoiseGenerator", "trackId":1206450560, "sellerName":"TMSOFT", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true},

"description":"A background running, multitasking enabled app, that alerts you to loss of cell / wifi service!\n\nNew! Now supports EMAIL of the full data logging of loss of cell service. A full color map showing pins where each location of no cell service occurred. You can now email yourself (or anyone) a complete log sorted by date (with Carrier name) of the long/lat data and time of cell service lost.\n\nNeed to know when you lose cell phone reception? Even if your phone is in your pocket or briefcase? This is the app!\n\nWorried about the reception issues you have read about? This app is always watching for loss of reception, even when you are not looking, and will alert you if it happens. A must for people who cannot afford to miss calls! Nurses, Doctors, Police, Firefighters, Moms and Dads: Never miss that important call again because you are in a dead spot with no cell service.\n\nNote: Known limitation: If you are connected to a known WiFi network, this app cannot detect the loss of 3G/4G/LTE while connected to WiFi, I am actively working on a solution to this. For a workaround, turn off WiFi if you absolutely need to know when the cellular signal drops out at all times.\n \nDon't ever miss an important call or SMS text message again, unaware that you have no cell service. Have Cell Guardian monitor for you - from the background!\n\n** New! Mute toggle for Wifi alerts and Battery Alerts per your feedback! thank you!\n\n** New! Now with AUDIBLE Low Battery Alerts. Warns you from the background with a pop up alert, plus sound, that your battery is below 50% and then below 30% and down to 5%: This is something the iPhone does not have built in, remember the older phones that would beep to warn you of low battery? now you can have that great feature back!**\n\n**No surprise bills in the mail!**\n\nLots of download apps for music and video can seamlessly go from your home Wi-Fi to a LTE network without a hiccup, thats great, but not so great if you have a capped data plan and have to pay for that LTE time! Let this app warn you when you leave Wi-Fi for LTE every-time. \n\nYou can easily test this app by turning Airplane mode on and off while the app is running, or by turning Wi-Fi on and off. You will see the pop up alerts.\n\nAnother fun way to test this: If you use Wi-Fi at home, walk around your block and see how far you can get before the app beeps to tell you you lost your Wi-Fi connection.\n\nIf you are not on iOS 4 or later yet, you can still use our \"No Signal\" app which runs on all versions of the OS (but does not run in background mode).\n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.", "bundleId":"com.janus.", "trackId":377264979, "sellerName":"Leland Roys", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true},

When possible, EnLighten also provides make/miss speed ranges based on the future state of the lights ahead. In addition, EnLighten provides a countdown to green when a driver is stopped at a red light, which can discourage drivers from starting distracting tasks when the light is about to change.\n\nWe’re expanding coverage quickly from a small set of pioneering cities.

"description":"Everybody knows that catching the start is essential in sailing. Finally there is a great Sailing Watch available for the iPhone and it works great with the Apple Watch.\n\nThis app provides a timer with unique features and unparalleled ease of use for sail racing. When you hear or see a race signal just press Gun! - You can adjust if it is a 5, 4 or 1 minute warning afterwards!  And if it was just a loud noise from a flapping sail and not a race signal you can easily jump back to the previous timer.\n\nIt defaults to the standard ISAF 5,4,1,0 sequence but it can handle arbitrary countdown from 30 minutes down to 0\n\nNow you can focus on other things like wind (directly in the app - simply configure your own favourite weather on the config page) and other boats potentially giving you yet another edge!\n\n** Please read more on the info \"i\" page in the app **\n\nYou can enable GPS and get Speed over Ground (SOG) and Course over Ground (COG) presented next to the timer to help you keep track of wind and speed in the seconds before and after start. The Wind page shows a graph of COG and SOG which can help you track wind shifts.\n\nThe app also provides convenient direct access to your configurable weather page.\n\nIt is designed to work on iPhone with or without Apple Watch and a lot of people seem to be using it with iPads as well.\n\nTIP: On the Watch it is recommended that you (at least temporarily) activate Resume to Last Used App so that you just have to raise your wrist to get the time left:\nSettings->General->Activate on Wrist Raise->Resume to: Last Used App\n\nThe iPhone application also contains a convenient reference to starting signals and customisable local weather information.\n\nHealthKit integration:\nThe app provides limited HealthKit integration and can optionally start a Sailing Workout activity during race start.\n\nSummary of Features:\n* Simply the best countdown timer ever if you ask us :)\n* Most of the feature work on Watch and  iPhone. Watch Series 2 needed for GPS without iPhone nearby.\n* Current Course and Speed Over Ground based on GPS\n* GPS based distance to line (still being tuned but works - within limits of GPS accuracy)\n* Speed up / Slow down estimate for time to get to line\n* History plot of Course and Speed Over Ground that allow you to track wind shifts\n* Prevalent headings - advanced formula lists common headings to help identify windshifts\n* Man Over Board function - it shows time, distance and compass bearing to the location the button was pressed (NOTE: intended as a secondary non life critical aid only) \n* Embedded browser for convenient access to your favourite weather (configurable)\n* ISAF Race Signals reference - to help settle what that strange flag shown on the race committee means before the race starts...\n* Choice of Magnetic or True course indication\n* Lock function to prevent unwanted changes\n\n\nNOTE: If you have iPhone sound problems when app is started in background check your mute button and volume, bring the iPhone app to the foreground, you can also test sound on the settings page.\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: If you enable the GPS feature the app runs in the background for a limited time before it disables GPS.\n\n\"Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\"", "bundleId":"Olcom-Invest.Race-Master", "trackId":995452178, "sellerName":"Kewlanu AB", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true},

"description":"Three tools (oscilloscope, FFT analyzer (spectrum analyzer), signal generator) are included in the e-scope 3-in-1.\n\nPlease take a look at this video.\nBasic functions:\nhttp://youtu.be/WPm4Dbz0WAo\nAutomatic measurement add-on:\nhttp://youtu.be/K6_stq_t2zQ\n\nIt can observe the frequency characteristics of audio devices using an FFT analyzer and a signal generator.\nObservation of frequency characteristics in real time is possible by using the FFT synchronization sweep mode.\ninputs are acquired via the built-in microphone or headset connector.\n\n-Oscilloscope\nThe oscilloscope has three modes.\n* Normal mode: It is suited to observe music waveforms.\n* Trigger mode: This mode is suitable for repeated waveforms such as sine wave. You can observe waveforms in stationary condition.\n* Single mode: This mode is suitable for observing one-time waveform such as impact sound.\nYou can change the sensitivity and time span by pinch out and pinch in.\n\n-FFT analyzer\nIt is possible to analyze the frequency spectrum of an input signal.\nThe peak level and the frequency are displayed at the top of the screen. The display can also be used as a simple frequency counter when you enter a single signal.\nIn addition, the THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) value is displayed at the bottom left of the screen.\nBy pressing the resolution button, you can select the frequency resolution free three types.\nWhen you press the peak hold button, the maximum value of the signal that you are currently viewing is displayed in a red line.\n\n-Signal generator\nThe signal generator can be used to generate a signal of four types:\nSine wave of 1Hz to 20kHz, White noise, Linear sweep and Log sweep ranging from 20Hz to 20KHz.\nWhen you tap the area that displays the frequency or sweep time range, a picker will appear. Please set the appropriate numbers in it.\nBy using the mode [optimized for FFT], it can automatically change to a frequency with highest FFT accuracy.\nPlease use the feature if you want to accurately measure the THD.\nWhile the frequency is displayed, it will be ignored when you enter 0000.\nDuring the FFT synchronization sweep mode, when you enter 000 as the display start time for the sweep time display, the FFT synchronization sweep mode will be activated. It will change the frequency at high speed in FFT analysis unit time (less than 0.1 seconds) .\nIt is possible to observe the frequency characteristic in real time in this mode.\n\nWhen you press the Copy button at any mode, you can capture screen and save it to a camera roll.", "bundleId":"jp.co.e-skett.e-scope", "trackId":660574048, "sellerName":"E-SKETT CORPORATION", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true},

"description":"Signal Flags Communicator enables a unique form of communication using flag images.  It is both a training aid to those wanting to learn to recognize the flags of the International Code of Signals, and an app to support and ensure privacy of communications, immediately, for anyone, with or without knowledge of the flags.\n\nIn operation, Signal Flags Communicator instantly translates written or spoken (via Siri) text into corresponding flag images, constructs a graphic representation of the text, and a proprietary FlagMessage file.  Once the composition is complete,  the graphic (PDF) image can be sent via email or text, and is printable on any AirPrint capable printer.  The FlagMessage file, which is simultaneously created, is intended for peer-to-peer communications via AirDrop or email attachment.  Recipients of the FlagMessage file, as peers,  can use their own Signal Flags Communicator app to translate and interpret the message when received, and save it locally on their device.  Since neither the PDF nor the FlagMessage file contain any scannable text, the communication is resistant to any text scanning by 3rd parties.  When transmitted via AirDrop, communications are secure and directly from one device to another, with no 3rd party involvement.\n\nFeatures include:\n• composing, printing, and sending of flag images and message content via email, text and AirDrop \n• A “native” app; all data is self contained in a protected form on the device\n• can communicate securely peer-to-peer via AirDrop\n• email capability uses a text-free proprietary format that cannot be scanned for text by 3rd parties\n• text messaging support for transmission of flag image content via a text-free PDF file \n• AirPrint support for printing flag images on all capable printers, including roll printers\n• recipients without knowledge or access to the flags can read the messages via use of the app on their own device\n• includes all International Code, and USN/NATO flags and pennants\n• capability to setup a message book, searchable for message text or meaning", "bundleId":"com.gigs.Signal-Flags-Communicator", "trackId":911267963, "sellerName":"Gigs, Inc.", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true},

"description":"MidiFire is a free-form, modular CoreMIDI router, processor, monitor and clock source from the makers of MidiBridge.\n\nDrop and arrange MIDI ports and modules onto the canvas however you like and connect them up to start routing and processing your MIDI events. Pan, zoom and scroll the canvas. Add as many ports and modules as you wish. Connect them in series or parallel. Cascade them together. Merge and split. You can create highly complex MIDI processing setups. Or keep it simple - the choice is yours.\n\n▶ FEATURES\n\nEssential processing modules for channelising, filtering, transposing, 'monofying', remapping and monitoring - or create your own. All included with the standard app.\n\nA highly accurate remotely controllable MIDI clock source.\n\nSave your work into recallable/re-usable scenes. Share your scenes with other devices, computers and people. Switch between your scenes via configurable MIDI program change messages.\n\nDownload even more functionality within the app for free using the 'Scenes Club' for useful and special-purpose scenes that you can incorporate into your workflow.\n\nInitiate and connect Bluetooth MIDI sessions within the application.\n\nDefine multiple virtual CoreMIDI ports to segregate your MIDI streams.\n\n▶ COMPATIBILITY\n\nMidiFire supports all CoreMIDI hardware interfaces, the network interface, virtual ports (self owned or other apps') and Bluetooth MIDI.\n\nAlso available for mac on the Mac App Store. Scene files are interchangeable between iOS and macOS.\n\n▶ STREAM BYTER (II)\n\nWhat sets MidiFire apart is the newly extended Stream Byter module first pioneered in MidiBridge. With this you can write your own processing modules using textual rules.\n\nNewly added constructs to the Stream Byter include: IF/THEN, local/global variables, mathematical functions, timing variables, 'onload' rules, setting of block labels and sending arbitrary MIDI data. The Stream Byter is backwards compatible with rulesets you already have from MidiBridge; just copy/paste them in.\n\n▶ NICHE MODULES\n\nAlso included are some specialised modules:\n\n• Tracking Clamp - reduce tracking miss-hits from MIDI guitars.\n\n• Robotic Knob - generate complementary CC messages to control synths and FX based on your playing.\n\n• OSC Exchange - send and receive OSC data across a MIDI channel (DIN, USB, wifi or Bluetooth) between MidiFire instances.\n\n▶ FURTHER INFORMATION\n\nFor tutorial videos, full manual and more, please visit the MidiFire website - http://midifi.re\n\nFor assistance in writing Stream Byter rules please email us or join the 'Audeonic Soapbox' forum - http://soapbox.audeonic.com and post your requirements there.\n\n* Powered by the MidiBus library.", "bundleId":"com.audeonic.midifire", "trackId":906600872, "sellerName":"Soft Audio", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true},

"description":"A high-quality audio Signal Generator for the iPhone. \n\nNow you can have a professional grade signal generator for your iPhone. Create sine waves, square waves, white noise, and pink noise.\n\nDon't let the well-worn look of this classic audio must-have fool you, Generator is accurate, reliable, precise, and clean.\n\n** NEW! Now supports remote control over WiFi from our AudioTools app. Connect an iOS device running Generator to your audio system, link to AudioTools on another device, and control Generator from AudioTools as you are free to move around. Requires that both devices be on the same LAN.\n\nIn sine and square wave mode, you can select between 20Hz and 20kHz using a controller that has three resolutions: octave, 1/3 octave, and fine. Frequency selection is controlled by smooth-gliding interlocking control wheels. Just spin to change frequency, by octaves, 1/3 octaves, or select fine mode to sweep through any value.\n\n*** NEW: Tap the frequency screen to pop up a keyboard so that you can enter any exact frequency.\n\n*** NEW: Tap the Wobble button to create a warble-tone signal for acoustics work. Doubles as an emergency siren!\n\nWhen you are generating pink noise and white noise, you can select full band (20Hz-20kHz), or octave band limited noise for acoustical testing.\n\nAll waveforms are laboratory accurate, and use ANSI / IEC spec filters where appropriate. \n\nThe frequency sweeps smoothly, with no glitches. The mute is soft, to prevent loud impulses when mute or turning on a lower-frequency signal.\n\nThis signal can be sent to both channels (stereo), just the right or left channel, or the right channel output phase can be inverted for pseudo-balanced mode. This mode can be used with our iPhone Balanced Cable Adapter to get a balanced signal from your iPhone. See our web site for more information.\n\nOn an iPhone 3G, we have measured distortion at .006% THD at 1000Hz at full volume (+6.5dBu balanced). See our web site for more level details.\n\nNote that digital square waves suffer from aliasing problems, and sound very strange above about 1500Hz. \n\nFuture versions will have options to select different skins.\n\nCheck out out other great professional-grade audio and acoustics apps: SPL, the iPhone professional-grade sound level meter, SPL Graph, for recording SPL over time, RTA, a 1/3 octave real time analyzer, FFT, for detailed audio analysis, ETC, the iPhone energy-time curve and decay app, RT60, for automated octave-band decay measurement, and Speaker Pop, the speaker polarity tester.\n\nEmail us within any questions, problems, or suggestions, we answer all emails promptly.", "bundleId":"com.studiosix.Generator", "trackId":298840802, "sellerName":"Andrew Smith", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true},

"description":"Audio Kit is a collection of four tools which are essential for those working in audio, sound and music. A real time Spectrum Analyser, a Scope to display waveforms, an SPL (Sound Pressure Level) Meter, and a Signal Generator producing sine waves, white noise and pink noise. Sweep generation with In App Purchase.\n\u2028\n-View a real time spectrum of audio with the Spectrum Analyser and identify peak frequencies precisely\n\n\u2028-View the actual waveform of the audio signal with the Scope \n\n\u2028-An SPL Meter provides measurement of sound levels using an A-weighting\n\n\u2028-The Signal Generator provides a sine wave output up to 20,000Hz in 1 Hz steps, along with noise generators for white and pink noise. Sweep generation with In App Purchase\n\n** Spectrum\u2028 **\n\nFFT (Fast Fourier Transform) is used to calculate the frequencies in the Spectrum Analyser and these are displayed in real time. The frequency is displayed in either logarithmic or linear scale.\n\nThree FFT sizes of 8192, 4096 and 2048 are selectable, giving fine resolution of frequencies. Interpolation gives resolution to within 1Hz.\n\n\u20286 different FFT window function types can be selected - Hamming, Hann, Rectangular, Bartlett, Triangular and Blackman. \u2028 \n\nNumber of FFT windows can be selected from 1 through 4.\n\nThe strongest frequency is displayed both above the peak, and optionally, in a large number display in the center of the screen. The large number display can be quickly switched on or off by double tapping the screen.\u2028\n\nThere is a screen capture facility in the Spectrum Analyser allowing you to save the spectra  for future reference along with details of the FFT parameters, time and date.\u2028 \n\nA single tap freezes the screen. Other features such as screen capture and double tap to toggle large number display still work during the freeze. This feature can be turned off in preferences if it’s not desired.\u2028\n\n** Scope ** \n\nThe display of the Scope can be adjusted easily using pinch gestures in both horizontal and vertical directions. Zero crossing detection of the waveform provides a smooth display and can be set to either positive or negative direction zero crossing.\n\n\u2028\u2028There is a screen capture facility in the Scope allowing you to save waveforms for future reference.\u2028\n\n** SPL Meter ** \n\n\u2028The SPL Meter continuously displays the sound pressure level using an A-weighting, and has resettable minimum and maximum displays also. \n\nSPL Meter can be calibrated against a reference standard or meter.\n\nSPL Meter has a continuous ticker style trace of the SPL over time.\u2028\n\n** Signal Generator ** \n\u2028 \nThe Signal Generator has 3 different output types: \n\n- Sine wave \n- White noise \n- Pink noise \n\n\u2028The output of the Signal Generator can be viewed on the other parts of the App.\u2028 \n\nThe sine wave frequency selected using picker wheels allows for accurate control of frequency to within 1Hz. Volume for the sine wave and noise signals is continuously adjustable.\u2028\u2028\n\nWith an In App Purpose one can add a sine wave sweep generator functionality to the Signal Generator. The sweep generator can sweep increasing and decreasing frequencies, and using either a linear or log sweep rate.\n\n**Settings\u2028 **\n\nAll of the user preferences in each of the above applications can be made persistent between restarts of the App. \n\nAll parts of the App have direct access to a help document. \n\nAudio Kit - essential for those working in audio, sound and music.", "bundleId":"com.sinusoid.audiokit", "trackId":376965050, "sellerName":"Sinusoid Pty Ltd", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true},

"description":"\"I use this for analog, and audio measurements. Attach an Apple USB adapter and a $40 stereo A-D converter available online, and my iPad is like a $300 O'Scope.\" -thymeout-\n\nOscilloscope app is great for analyzing audio range signals, or learning oscilloscope measurement basics. The interface includes many standard oscilloscope controls, such as: triggering, time and voltage per division, signal measurement cursors, and more.\n\nThe app incorporates a signal (function) generator capable of generating sine, square, triangle, and sawtooth waveforms of up to 22 KHz. Calibration to an external reference signal is supported, guaranteeing the accuracy of measurements. \n\nInput can be acquired via the built-in microphone or an external mic/probe connected to the headset connector. For best results, use an external audio interface connected to your device dock. This allows for standard audio equipment to be connected, as well as for dual channel input. Oscilloscope probes also be connected (using a BNC connector). When feeding external signals via probes, you should take care not to exceed 1V AC voltage. Currently iDevices support only AC input. \n\nFor up-to-date information on feeding signals and currently supported audio interfaces, please visit http://oa.onyx3.com\n \n\nFeature Highlights: \n● Real-time waveform display (60 FPS) \n● Triggering modes: Normal, Auto, Single \n● Set trigger level and pre-trigger time \n● Dual channel signal generator \n● Reference signal calibration \n● Pause function to get a screen capture \n● Export traces as text file for further analysis\n● Measure signal data using cursors \n● Use \"finger pinch\" on screen to set voltage and time base \n● Double tap screen to enter Black Panel mode \n● Three color themes to choose from \n● XY mode for viewing Lissajous figures \n● Frequency range 20Hz-22KHz \n● iPhone X ready", "bundleId":"com.onyx3.oscilloscope", "trackId":388636804, "sellerName":"ONYX 3", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true},

When you absolutely positively have to get out of bed at a certain time, you need the most annoying and abrasive sounds known to man (or woman).\n\nYou choose a loud, obnoxious noise, such as, Angry Cat or Chalkboard Fingernails, then set your day and time. Be sure to turn your device's sound to ON, and turn the volume all the way UP! The app even has a pop-up to remind you to do this. Then, simply put your iPhone, iPad, or iPod to sleep by pressing the button no the top.\n\nIt's that easy.\n\nYou can rest assured (literally) that you'll be on time for that final exam or business flight because Crazy Alarm Clock will send you 5 timed alerts, a minute apart. Just to warn you, there is no \"Snooze\" button! We can't guarantee that you'll get restful sleep, but you WILL get out of bed.\n\nEven if you just need a simple daily signal or a safe, timed plan to keep dinner from getting charred, Crazy Alarm Clock is the key. Here's what you get:\n\n- Simplicity – Listen to the loud sounds, choose one, and set the alarm.\n- Easy Sorting – Select your favorite sounds or arrange alphabetically.\n- Cool Design – Check out the screenshots below.\n- Obnoxious Sounds – The air horn WILL wake you up!\n- Great Extras – Upgrade to get full access to all the crazy sounds.\n\nNobody wants to be the idiot who sleeps through college graduation.

"description":"Crude oil is a naturally-occurring substance found in certain rock formations in the earth and can be considered the most important commodity in the world today. The product and its derivatives can be found in many application of modern life from transportation to plastics.\n\nCurrently, there are two major benchmarks for world oil prices, West Texas Intermediate (WTI for short) and Brent crude oil. Both are light, sweet crude oils although WTI is relatively sweeter and lighter than its European counterpart. As a result of this, WTI often trades at a premium, usually by just a few dollars a barrel. However, due to a Libyan crisis, which has decreased the supply of light, sweet crude in the European region, and a supply glut at the main storage facility of WTI in Oklahoma, the premium/discount situation has changed and now Brent is more expensive than WTI.\n\nThe recent slump in oil prices present a good investment opportunity.\n\nKey features of Easy Oil Tracker:\n\n- Keep a close watch of the latest oil price using an easy to read dashboard so as to know when is a good time to enter or exit the market.\n- News ticker displaying important news related to oil.\n- Keep yourself informed of the latest news related to oil by reading the list of headline news.\n- Receive notification when oil price moves more than 7%.\n- Share current WTI/Brent oil price with family and friends.\n- Quick access to the Economic Calendar from Forex Factory.\n- Technical analysis of the prices.
