"description":"OpenSignal is the ultimate signal toolkit that shows you how to get a better network connection instantly, find nearby free Wifi hotspots worldwide, view signal maps so that you can compare performance of networks in your area and test the speed of your mobile or Wifi connection. \n\nUnlike other apps, which look for maximum possible speed through optimized testing, OpenSignal informs you about your true speed - what you are likely to experience when normally using your phone. Anyone using the app contributes data, informing others about real-world, not estimated, mobile performance (and we'll never ask you for personal information, just your signal strength stats).\n\nWith OpenSignal you can map cellular coverage, find Wi-Fi hotspots, test and improve your reception & get faster data.\n\n- Signal compass points you in the direction your signal is coming from \n- Speed test for download, upload and latency\n- Map of cell towers and Wifi hotspots\n- Coverage maps allow you see the best/worst places for 2G, 3G and 4G \n- Free and ad-free\n\nBased on our community-generated data we are able to help keep you better connected by giving you a practical solution to the problems of slow mobile internet. Simply follow our signal compass to walk towards better phone signal or see our in-app copoverage maps to work out which carrier is best for where you are, useful if you're thinking about switching networks. Our wifi maps help you find local public-access wireless networks (Wifi hotspots).\n\nMaps are not updated in real-time. Don’t worry though, we log the information you share with us to improve our coverage maps and performance information. We’re working hard to make sure the data you contribute to the project is available to everyone as quickly as possible. \n\nTips:\n- Not all towers and wireless hotspots are in our database - we’re working on it!\n- Moving in the direction of your cell tower (the signal compass) will not always improve reception due to interference effects/local geography\n- Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nIf you read to here (!) you should really join the OpenSignal beta to help us improve the app, just email hi@opensignal.com if you're interested.", "bundleId":"com.opensignal.OpenSignalMaps", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "genreIds":["6002", "6007"], "averageUserRating":2.0, "userRatingCount":10},

"description":"Generate pure sine wave tones at frequencies from 20hz to 22,000hz.  Tone generation is useful in tuning instruments, hearing tests, science experiments, and testing audio equipment.\n\nTone Generator has many uses:\n- Hearing Test:  What is the lowest/highest frequency you can hear in each ear?\n- Tuning Instruments:  Does your top guitar string match Low E at 440 Hz?\n- Science Experiments:  What is the resonant frequency of your wine glass?\n- Audio System Test:  What frequencies does your subwoofer support?\n\nDirections:\nAdjust audio frequency by dragging the slider or tapping the plus/minus buttons.  Adjust device volume using the on-screen volume slider.  You can also specify to play audio to any AirPlay supported device.  Toggle audio playback using the Play/Pause button.\n\nCreated by the audio experts at TMSOFT that brought you the famous White Noise app.  Check out all our apps and sounds at http://www.tmsoft.com/", "bundleId":"com.tmsoft.ToneGenerator", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "genreIds":["6011", "6002"]},

You can connect to an existing Google account, create new accounts on public XMPP servers (including via Tor), or even connect to your own server for extra security.\n\nUnlike other apps that keep you stuck in their walled garden, ChatSecure is fully interoperable with other clients that support OTR and XMPP, such as Adium, Jitsi, and more.\n\nChatSecure only uses well-known open source cryptographic libraries to keep your conversations private. Other apps may make claims about 'military grade' security but, without publicly auditable source code and verifiable end-to-end encryption, you cannot be truly safe.\n\n* XMPP with TLS certificate pinning.\n* OTR for verifiable end-to-end encryption and forward secrecy.\n* OMEMO for a mobile-friendly alternative to OTR.\n* Tor integration for easy access to XMPP .onion services.\n* SQLCipher to locally encrypt conversation logs.\n* Free and Open Source: https://github.com/chatsecure/chatsecure-ios\n\nFollow @ChatSecure on Twitter: https://twitter.com/chatsecure\n\n►► ChatSecure Donations\nSubscribe to ChatSecure to help make developing free and open source privacy tools sustainable.

Not only does testing performance in your neighborhood provide you with useful insights, but the data you produce also helps carriers improve the quality of your mobile life.\n\nThe newest version of the app for iOS has expanded the functionality and ease of use found in previous versions to give you a personal network testing and comparison tool that’s better than ever. And whether you’re already familiar with our CoverageMap app or simply curious about testing mobile network performance in your neighborhood, you’ll quickly see how easy it is to get started.\n\nNew features:\n•\tImproved user interface. Our updated app not only boasts a beautiful new user interface, but it also makes it easy to find and select the options and settings you want to use before running a test. Plus, easily identify areas that have yet to be tested, and be the first to put yourself on the map. \n•\tA world of results on an expanded dashboard. Your test results can tell you a great deal about your daily mobile life. Get a broader understanding of your findings with new stats such as moving averages, histories, and more. \n•\tPersonalize your results. Wondering how performance with your carrier of choice compares between the office and at home? Now you can find out.

While we love to see more and more data points appear on the map, you can also tell us about your experience in your own words. Whether it’s something you feel requires our attention, or you just want to say you’ve had a great experience testing performance, we want to hear from you.\n\nEnjoying the app?

"description":"Confide is your confidential messenger. With end-to-end encrypted, self-destructing, and screenshot-proof messages, Confide gives you the comfort of knowing that your private communication will now truly stay that way.\n\n• Messages are end-to-end encrypted\n• Messages disappear forever once they are read\n• Screenshot-proof messages with our patent-pending ScreenShield technology\n• Send text, photos, videos, documents and voice messages\n• 1-to-1 and group messaging\n• Available for mobile, desktop, iMessage and Siri\n\nAlso available from Confide:\n\nConfide Plus — More features. More control.\n• Unlimited attachments\n• Retract (\"un-send\") an unread message\n• Nicknames\n• Themes\n• Priority customer support\n\nConfide has been used in over 180 countries and has been featured in Fortune, Forbes, Bloomberg, NYT, WSJ, Washington Post and more.\n\nConfide allows you to communicate digitally with the same level of privacy and security as the spoken word.\n\nGet Confide and retake control of your digital conversations.\n\n———\n\nScreenShield is a new technology that is only supported when the message recipient is using a recent version of Confide. But don’t worry, older versions of Confide are still screenshot-protected by our reading experience.\n\n———\n\nConfide for iMessage allows you to send and receive Confide messages entirely within iMessage. It’s completely frictionless – there’s no need to create an account. Due to technical limitations of iMessage, Confide for iMessage does not offer the same level of screenshot protection as the main version of Confide.\n\n———\n\nPrice may vary by location.

"description":"ABOUT THIS COURSE\n\nThis course introduces signal processing tools currently used in geophysics. It has been elaborated both from the book \"Signal processing for geologists and geophysicists\" (J.L. Mari, F. Glangeaud, F. Coppens, 1999) and from the CD \"Signal processing in geosciences\" (F. Glangeaud ,J.L. Mari, 2000).\n\nFor signal processing specialists, it will be a source of how classical or new theories can be applied to field data.Teaching staff should find it provides a means of tackling the teaching signal processing techniques.\n\n- - -\n\nFOREWORD\n\nThis on line course presents a succession of lessons classed by theme. The different themes that are tackled are:\n\n• The Fourier Transformation\n• Common functions in spectral analysis\n• Sampling\n• Correlation\n• Wave separation\n• Seismic applications\n• The Hilbert transformation\n• Filtering\n• Near Surface Geophysics\n• Stochastic Signal Processing\n• Attributes\n\nEach theme has an introduction and a series of lessons which are associated with it. A lesson comprises of text, a video, a formulary, if judged necessary, and in some cases an applet to practice.\n\n• The text present has been voluntarily reduced; its objective is put across by the animation. This objective may be the presentation of a specific transform used in signal processing and applied in seismic processing. The term \"transform\" is used here in a very general sense. It covers at times the notion of transformation, such as the Fourier transformation or filters such as the Wiener filter. The objective perhaps being to show the application of a \"transform\" on simulated synthetic data or on real acquired geophysical data.\n\n• The video is an illustration of the text. It permits a visualization of the data, to study the influence of processing parameters on the data. The images were conceived in a manner which permits an immediate visual comparison and that enables an evaluation of the influence of a parameter change on the data processing. If an applet is associated with the video, some parameters can be modified by moving the cursors, the calculations taking place in real time.\n\n• The formulary gives the mathematical formula used in the animation. The reader is invited to use the book cited above as a reference for the notations used and the demonstrations. The formulary should be considered as a simple memory aid.\n\nThe videos and the applets have been created thanks to the MUSTIG software ( mustig.free.fr, Gérard Lejeune).\nIn this on line course, 20 lessons can be selected. For the animations based on field data measurement, the authors or organisms that provide with them are mentioned.\n\nThis on line course does not constitute a complete course in itself ; referral to the basic signal processing texts remains essential.\n\n- - -\n\nTHE AUTHOR\n\nJean-Luc Mari is at present a geophysics professor at IFP School and an IFPEN expert. He supervises the MSc research program in \"Lithosphere, Basins, Petroleum\" part of the Master's program in Science and Technology (Paris VI).\n\nJean-Luc Mari is a member of the European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers.\n\nJean-Luc Mari is author and co-author of patents (in the field of acoustic well logging), numerous scientific articles and books on geophysical methods and signal processing.\n\nHe has been involved in the design and development of specific teaching aids (on-line (http://www-ig.unil.ch/cours/) and CD-ROMs).\n\nHis main fields of expertise are seismic acquisition and processing, geophysics of reservoirs and civil engineering.", "bundleId":"com.odysys.signalprocessing", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "genreIds":["6017", "6018"]},

"description":"\"Featured on The Next Web: http://thenextweb.com/apps/2013/04/29/reachfast-is-a-slick-contacts-app-for-iphone/\" \n\n** The Slickest way to call, message, and Facetime for iphone ** \n\nReachFast was designed for iphone to simplify the process of calling, searching, and adding contacts. Every detail has been optimized in order to save you time. By comparison, ReachFast is 1 to 3 times faster than other contacts apps in any given scenario.\n\n\nFeatures:\n* Pull-down to search, instead of tapping on a specific area. You can open the search without even looking at the screen.\n* Only One tap to call.\n* Two taps to Facetime.\n* Swipe right to message.\n* Favorites and Recently called contacts appear INLINE with the contacts... No need to switch tabs and the landing happens always on the recent, if you don't find the contact there, just pull down to search.\n* Smart search, that learns who you call the most and gives you the first result as a top hit, while reducing the number of letters you type before finding your contact.\n* Adding a contact is super fast. we don't stop you to ask if you are adding to existing or updating a new one, it happens along the way and reduces 3 steps out of the overall scenario.\n* While adding a contact, no need to move your finger and look at the upper screen to switch fields, you can swipe the keyboard to jump lines while keeping your fingers on the keyboard to save you time.\n* Forgot their names? View your contacts Chronologically. \n* Ability to show pictures, organize by first name, sounds, vibration, show emails etc.", "bundleId":"com.completure.com.contacts", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "genreIds":["6007", "6002"]},

"description":"Signal Flags is an authority for identification, interpretation and use of signal flags between ships. This comprehensive app is your resource for signal flag information as specified by the International Code of Signals, the U.S. Navy, the International Sailing Federation, NATO, and Allied Forces around the world. Everything you need to know or want to know is in here.\n\n“I am a blue water sailor, cruising the East Coast of the U.S. and out to Bermuda. This app [contains] a copy of H.O. Pub 102 which is carried on the signal bridge of every commercial ship in the world. As the code meanings are uniform regardless of the nationality of the ship involved, a Portugese fisherman can use the code to request medical advice from the doctor onboard a Norwegian cruise ship even though neither speaks the other's language. Naturally, the paper copy is easier to use, but this is great in a pinch, and is a good study tool...”\n- GHK3\n\nIt's a beautiful day as you cruise the harbor in your new boat. The smell of sea water and being captain of your own vessel is pretty heady. Taking in the view, you notice a Naval ship flying unusual flags in the area you’re heading for. There’s an “A” flag, followed by a number 3 flag. You know that seafaring vessels have special signals but you don’t know what they mean. Whipping out your Signal Flags app, you quickly scroll, tapping the appropriate flags to discover that you must avoid the ship within 300 yards as they have divers in the water. You adjust your course a little to comply. Thank goodness you were able to find out before you intruded on the ship’s operation.\n\nSignal Flags have been used for communication between ships at sea since ancient times. They have evolved throughout history and now are uniformly mandated by the International Code of Signals. The flags remove the language barrier by indicating with symbols, many types of distress and information to all U.S. and Allied Forces around the globe. They are used by government, military and civilians traveling the world’s waterways.\n\nThe app contains all of the images, flags and pennants that you’ll need to know, along with detailed descriptions of their usage and meanings in international, military, and sail racing contexts. You don’t need a cumbersome book; you don’t even need an internet connection. Just pull out your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch and open Signal Flags. All the important information is contained right there in the application. Within a few seconds, you’ll know what that ship is telling you.\n\nIn addition to the signal details, this app supplies you with the complete documentation of the NIMA pub. 102 and the U.S. Department of Transportation/U.S. Coast Guard Navigation Rules (COMDTINST M16672.2D).  Both documents include extensive in-document hyperlinks for accessibility along with a specialized toolbar for quick and simple browsing.  A specialized quiz function is also provided to aid in memorization of the entire flag set. \n\n\u2028Features:\n\n* Designed and developed by a U.S. Naval Academy graduate\n* Needs no network connection once downloaded\n* Contains all current signal flag details\n* Contains complete documentation as laid out by governing sources\n* Includes a quiz function to help you memorize all the flags\n\nIf you spend time on the open water, are the employee of an organization that navigates the seas, a yacht racer, or an interested student, this application is an indispensable tool. Everything is here for you, at your fingertips, anytime, anywhere.

"description":"Generate custom color noises including brown, pink, white, blue, and violet.  Customize noise further by using low and high cut filters. Simple modern interface remembers all settings for quick generation and utilizes advanced mathematical formulas to generate all audio waves.  There are no audio files included in the application binary which keeps app size to a minimum and app performance to a maximum.\n\nWhat are benefits of listening to white noise?\n- Helps you sleep by blocking distractions\n- Pacifies fussy and crying babies\n- Relaxes and reduces stress\n- Increases focus while enhancing privacy\n- Soothes headaches and migraines\n- Masks tinnitus (ringing of the ears)\n\nWhat are the different sound colors?\n- White noise sounds similar to static of an analog TV or radio station that has stopped broadcasting.   White noise has equal energy across all sound frequencies.\n- Brown noise sounds like a powerful waterfall.  It has more energy at the lower frequencies and if you have a good speaker system with a subwoofer you should be able to really feel it.\n- Pink noise's upper sound frequencies don't fall off as fast as they do with brown noise, so you'll get a little more punch. The most interesting thing about pink noise is it's found in almost all electronic devices (known as flicker noise) and even in biological systems.\n- Blue and violet noise are the opposites of pink and brown noise, respectively, and sound like spraying water from a garden hose. It has more energy at the higher frequencies which means more treble and less bass. \n- Curious to learn more about color noises?  Check out this article for all the details:  http://www.tmsoft.com/white-noise-player/\n\nDirections:\nDrag the Sound Color slider to select brown, pink, white, blue, violet, or somewhere in-between.  Next, drag the low and high cut filters to further customize to your liking.  Adjust device volume using the on-screen volume slider to a comfortable level.  You can also specify to play audio to any AirPlay supported device.  Toggle audio playback using the Play/Pause button.\n\nCreated by the audio experts at TMSOFT that brought you the famous White Noise app.  Check out all our apps and sounds at http://www.tmsoft.com/", "bundleId":"com.tmsoft.NoiseGenerator", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "genreIds":["6002", "6020"]},

"description":"SPL Meter is a professional-grade sound level meter, also known as a decibel or dB meter, for your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nModeled after a traditional analog SPL meter, we have faithfully reproduced all the characteristics and qualities found in those meters, including the ballistics, ranges, filters, and decay rates.\n\nUnder the hood we have advanced DSP-based algorithms that meet or exceed ANSI / IEC Type 1 standards. And starting with iOS 6, we can disable the mic filters and limiters, to get the real world performance of a hand-held SPL meter.\n\nAnd now, upgrade SPL Meter with iTestMic, our pro-grade test & measurement mic, made specifically for iOS devices. Using iTestMic with SPL Meter, you get a calibrated, accurate SPL Meter, that meets industry standards for Type 2 performance. See our website for more information.\n\nBut don't compare us to a Radio Shack meter, ours is much more accurate! \n\nWe have also included a digital LCD display, as shown in the image, to make this the best SPL meter available for iPhone or iPad. And this is something that the old analog meters never had! \n\nThe screen will flip when you flip the phone over, so that you can point the iPhone mic directly at the sound source. (iPhone X does not support upside down mode)\n\nSPL Meter is a universal app -- buy once, and use on all of your iOS devices.\n\nSPL Meter is built by the same team that created the other great professional audio and acoustics apps on the store, Studio Six Digital.  Built on the engine of our more expensive \"SPL\" app, SPL Meter's filters and decay rates meet or exceed ANSI type 1. This app is not a toy or a game.\n\nSPL Meter is the one audio app that everyone who works in audio must have on their phone! Not only have we made the best one, but we've priced it so you can't afford not to get it.\n\n*** FEATURES:\n\nFILTERS -- A and C weighting filters are provided.\n\nDECAY -- Choose ANSI Fast or Slow.\n\nRANGES -- 40dB to 120dB in 9 ranges.\n\nCALIBRATION -- Comes pre-calibrated for the typical iPhone or iPad built-in and headset mic, but you can adjust the calibration if you have a professional, calibrated meter to compare it to. Accesses our cloud-based iOS device calibration database, which we updates as new devices are released.\n\nINTERNAL / EXTERNAL MIC -- Select Internal to activate the included compensation filter, which is designed to flatten the frequency response of the built-in or headset mic. External will work with our iPhone Measurement Mic, to be released later this summer.

The trading signals are focused on currency pairs that can have an impact because of the news released.\n\nWe then consider the technical factors that could influence the prices on an intraday basis by examining the support and resistance levels, price action and volumes.\n\nAfter individually analysing the fundamental and technical outlook on the forex pair, we then stitch things together and assign a probability for which way the price could move and issue the signals accordingly. \n\nWe focus on the major currency pairs as they tend to be more liquid with tighter spreads.\n\nFor cryptocurrencies, we cover some of the top coins: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Dash.", "bundleId":"hr.apps.206889279", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "genreIds":["6015", "6017"]},

"description":"A Real Time Analyzer for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch. Test your speakers, tune your room, do acoustical analysis work or just have a better understanding of audio frequencies. RTA is a professional-grade acoustical analysis tool. All filters meet or exceed ANSI and IEC Class 1 specifications. \n\nIncludes Octave and 1/3 Octave modes, with selectable decay times, as well as Peak Hold and true linear Average mode.\n\n*** iOS Microphones\n\nWe have analyzied every iOS device, including all of the iPads, all iPhones, and iPod touches, and have created microphone compensation files that are applied automatically. You can trust the results you are getting, often within just a few dB of a far more expensive analyzer. Calibration is updated regularly, automatically, from our cloud-based calibration database.\n\nUpgrade to our iTestMic or iAudioInterface2 to bring your system up to full professional specs.\n\n*** Save and Recall Graphs\n\nYou can save and recall graphs, marked with the GPS location, date & time, and your comment, as well as store the image to your photo roll.\n\nExport the data as an XLS formatted file to your computer for inclusion in reports or further analysis.\n\n*** Max and Min Bars\n\nYou can also turn on resettable Max/Min bars (see image #4) to capture peaks. Double-tap to reset the bars.\n\n*** Specifications and Devices\n\nThe internal iPhone mic has a noise floor near 30 dB, and if your are running iOS 6, clips around 120 dB. \n\n*** Touch GUI\n\nFully interactive touch GUI features includes scroll up/down, pinch to zoom or compress the vertical dB scale, or swipe horizontally to get a cursor that reads out the exact dB level and frequency across the screen. To make the cursor disappear, swipe it off the graph to the left.\n\nThe landscape-mode display flips 180 degrees so that you can face the internal mic in either direction.\n\n*** Overlay Curves\n\nAlso included are optional noise curve overlays, in NCB, RC, PNC, NC, X-Curve and NR mode. See picture #2 for an example. Use this feature to get a quick reading on the noise levels in a room. Also includes the cinema large-room X-curve overlay.\n\n*** Calibration\n\nRTA can be fully calibrated, whether you are using it with the internal iOS microphone, or one of our professional test & measurement mic solutions. And, if you are using iTestMic, the mic calibration is transmitted directly to the app, so you are always calibrated.\n\n*** RTA or FFT?\n\nIf you are wondering if you should download this app or our FFT app, check out our website, we have a page devoted to this topic.\n\nSee our other acoustics and audio apps, including AudioTools.", "bundleId":"com.studiosix.RTA", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "genreIds":["6011", "6002"]},

"description":"Drakdoo is a Forex & Cryptocurrency trading app that offers touch friendly charts and intelligent alerts, allowing you to stay on top of all cryptocurrencies as well as traditional markets without being glued to the screen 24/7.\n\n- Perform in-depth analysis, annotate charts, using an interface tailored for mobile.\n\n- Continuous Notifications: Next to one-time alerts that fire when a price breach occurs, we also offer continuous alerts that fire each time the price moves by a configurable threshold.\n\n- Intelligent Alerts: Do you want to be notified when the current trend has a higher-than-normal probability of switching directions? Simply set up Parabolic SAR alert. Or, get notified via a Stochastic RSI alert when the market becomes overbought or oversold. MACD alerts fire each time a center line or signal line crossover occurs. Don't forget to setup an alert that fires when the Bollinger Bands are breached!\n\n- Next to the Forex pairs, all major cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), Ethereum (ETH), ...) and all major crypto exchanges (e.g. Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Huobi, Kraken, OKEX, Coinbase, Bitso, Poloniex, Bittrex, Bitcoin.co.id, and more...) are supported.\n\n- Not everybody is a programmer. Build your own indicator without programming, optionally spanning multiple charting periods.\n\n- You will be alerted in real-time when relevant price action occurs.\n\n- Setup just one alert and monitor all pairs, possibly hundreds, of an exchange.\n\nThe basic functionality of Drakdoo is free to use. There are three subscription plans that you can opt in to that enhance the basic functionality:\n\n- The Goldfish plan: next to price breach alerts, you will be able to make use of intelligent indicator alerts such as RSI. Price: $8.49 monthly, or, $68.99 annually.\n\n- The Shark plan: offering more advanced indicators, such as Ichimoku Cloud (a.o.) for advanced traders.  Price: $12.99 monthly, or, $103.99 annually.\n\n- The Whale plan: full featured functionality without compromise, including scripting your own indicator and exchange probing. Price: $16.99 monthly, or, $134.99 annually.\n\nPrices may vary depending on your country. Please refer to the plan browser available within the app for in depth plan comparisons.\n\nAll plans include a free trial of 3 days. Your iTunes account will be charged once you confirm your payment. Your subscription automatically renews. When this happens the same, the same iTunes account as the initial purchase will be charged again at the end of your subscription period unless auto-renew has been turned off in your iTunes Account Settings at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. In case of a price increase, your subscription will not automatically renew and you will be notified via your iTunes Account email address to opt-in for this increase.  In case of a price decrease, your subscription will still automatically renew, unless specified otherwise in your iTunes Account Settings. Turning off auto-renew or managing it, can be done at any time after purchase via your iTunes Account Settings.  Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription to that publication, where applicable.

"description":"A background running, multitasking enabled app, that alerts you to loss of cell / wifi service!\n\nNew! Now supports EMAIL of the full data logging of loss of cell service. A full color map showing pins where each location of no cell service occurred. You can now email yourself (or anyone) a complete log sorted by date (with Carrier name) of the long/lat data and time of cell service lost.\n\nNeed to know when you lose cell phone reception? Even if your phone is in your pocket or briefcase? This is the app!\n\nWorried about the reception issues you have read about? This app is always watching for loss of reception, even when you are not looking, and will alert you if it happens. A must for people who cannot afford to miss calls! Nurses, Doctors, Police, Firefighters, Moms and Dads: Never miss that important call again because you are in a dead spot with no cell service.\n\nNote: Known limitation: If you are connected to a known WiFi network, this app cannot detect the loss of 3G/4G/LTE while connected to WiFi, I am actively working on a solution to this. For a workaround, turn off WiFi if you absolutely need to know when the cellular signal drops out at all times.\n \nDon't ever miss an important call or SMS text message again, unaware that you have no cell service. Have Cell Guardian monitor for you - from the background!\n\n** New! Mute toggle for Wifi alerts and Battery Alerts per your feedback! thank you!\n\n** New! Now with AUDIBLE Low Battery Alerts. Warns you from the background with a pop up alert, plus sound, that your battery is below 50% and then below 30% and down to 5%: This is something the iPhone does not have built in, remember the older phones that would beep to warn you of low battery? now you can have that great feature back!**\n\n**No surprise bills in the mail!**\n\nLots of download apps for music and video can seamlessly go from your home Wi-Fi to a LTE network without a hiccup, thats great, but not so great if you have a capped data plan and have to pay for that LTE time! Let this app warn you when you leave Wi-Fi for LTE every-time. \n\nYou can easily test this app by turning Airplane mode on and off while the app is running, or by turning Wi-Fi on and off. You will see the pop up alerts.\n\nAnother fun way to test this: If you use Wi-Fi at home, walk around your block and see how far you can get before the app beeps to tell you you lost your Wi-Fi connection.\n\nIf you are not on iOS 4 or later yet, you can still use our \"No Signal\" app which runs on all versions of the OS (but does not run in background mode).\n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.", "bundleId":"com.janus.", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "genreIds":["6002", "6000"]},

"description":"Everybody knows that catching the start is essential in sailing. Finally there is a great Sailing Watch available for the iPhone and it works great with the Apple Watch.\n\nThis app provides a timer with unique features and unparalleled ease of use for sail racing. When you hear or see a race signal just press Gun! - You can adjust if it is a 5, 4 or 1 minute warning afterwards!  And if it was just a loud noise from a flapping sail and not a race signal you can easily jump back to the previous timer.\n\nIt defaults to the standard ISAF 5,4,1,0 sequence but it can handle arbitrary countdown from 30 minutes down to 0\n\nNow you can focus on other things like wind (directly in the app - simply configure your own favourite weather on the config page) and other boats potentially giving you yet another edge!\n\n** Please read more on the info \"i\" page in the app **\n\nYou can enable GPS and get Speed over Ground (SOG) and Course over Ground (COG) presented next to the timer to help you keep track of wind and speed in the seconds before and after start. The Wind page shows a graph of COG and SOG which can help you track wind shifts.\n\nThe app also provides convenient direct access to your configurable weather page.\n\nIt is designed to work on iPhone with or without Apple Watch and a lot of people seem to be using it with iPads as well.\n\nTIP: On the Watch it is recommended that you (at least temporarily) activate Resume to Last Used App so that you just have to raise your wrist to get the time left:\nSettings->General->Activate on Wrist Raise->Resume to: Last Used App\n\nThe iPhone application also contains a convenient reference to starting signals and customisable local weather information.\n\nHealthKit integration:\nThe app provides limited HealthKit integration and can optionally start a Sailing Workout activity during race start.\n\nSummary of Features:\n* Simply the best countdown timer ever if you ask us :)\n* Most of the feature work on Watch and  iPhone. Watch Series 2 needed for GPS without iPhone nearby.\n* Current Course and Speed Over Ground based on GPS\n* GPS based distance to line (still being tuned but works - within limits of GPS accuracy)\n* Speed up / Slow down estimate for time to get to line\n* History plot of Course and Speed Over Ground that allow you to track wind shifts\n* Prevalent headings - advanced formula lists common headings to help identify windshifts\n* Man Over Board function - it shows time, distance and compass bearing to the location the button was pressed (NOTE: intended as a secondary non life critical aid only) \n* Embedded browser for convenient access to your favourite weather (configurable)\n* ISAF Race Signals reference - to help settle what that strange flag shown on the race committee means before the race starts...\n* Choice of Magnetic or True course indication\n* Lock function to prevent unwanted changes\n\n\nNOTE: If you have iPhone sound problems when app is started in background check your mute button and volume, bring the iPhone app to the foreground, you can also test sound on the settings page.\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: If you enable the GPS feature the app runs in the background for a limited time before it disables GPS.\n\n\"Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\"", "bundleId":"Olcom-Invest.Race-Master", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "genreIds":["6004", "6002"]},

"description":"***** \"As a former IEEE Technical Committee Chair for Signal Processing, I find this app amazingly flexible and useful. Works very well with its proper designed-in control selections.\" - Roblake \n\nSpectrum Analyzer for iOS is a powerful real-time audio analysis app. Designed with musicians and recording engineers in mind, it can also be used by anyone interested in the world of sound. Ideal for room tuning or speaker tuning, the app enables portable, precision audio measurement and visualization. \n\nFeature Highlights: \n● Octave Band Real Time Analyzer \n● FFT Plot (Fast Fourier Transform) \n● Spectrograph module \n● Test Tone and White/Pink Noise Generator \n● Native iPhone X graphics\n\n>>> Check out the demo videos at SpectrumAnalyzerApp.com \n\nAudio input may be acquired via the built-in microphone or an external measurement microphone. For best results we recommend using a calibrated measurement microphone connected via USB audio interface or iPhone dock connector. This allows for high precision and flat frequency response, as well as for stereo input.\n\nAudio credits:\n\"Basement Floor\" and \"Enchanted Journey\" by Kevin MacLeod\n\"Evening Birdsong\" and \"Cuckoo\" by Benboncan", "bundleId":"com.onyx3.spectrumanalyzer", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "genreIds":["6011", "6002"]},

"releaseNotes":"The MPL application has been upgraded to new some new features, enhancements on existing features, and some minor bug fixes.  Here is a summary of what's new:\n\n1. Leakage Measurements via a Bluetooth-connected handheld leakage detection device from ComSonics are easier than ever.  The leakage tab has 3 new buttons/functions along with a measurement display:  Get Measurement, Submit Measurement, and Start Capture.  \"Get Measurement\" requests a leakage measurement across all enabled frequencies and the subsequent data is then displayed.  \"Submit Measurement\" submits the stored leakage measurement data to the ComSonics Genacis web app.  \"Start Capture\" requests that leakage measurements are taken continuously across all enabled frequencies until the measurements are stopped using the \"Stop Capture\" or Store functions.\n\n2. Live Map.  This is a new feature also found on the Leakage tab.  This allows a technician to view their GPS-based route in real time while either driving or walking.  While the Start Capture feature is active and MPL is connected to a handheld leakage detector, this features shows the GPS path and plots leakage on the map route.  Once the route is completed and measurements stopped, the leakage and route data is stored on the mobile device.\n\n3.

"description":"ComSonics’ has integrated the Compass Signal Leakage Platform with the Mobile Problem Locator (MPL). The MPL function provides the cable telecommunications user with the ability to record various types of issues found in the cable plant and other utilities such as power, telephone, gas, and water determined by visual inspection. The new Compass functionality adds a number of options for identifying, storing and forwarding signal leakage to the ComSonics' Genacis server as well as supporting job order maintenance. The CompassMPL app supports the ability to submit signal leaks, construction issues and work order closeouts for signal leakage type problems. Provisions are included for recording the location of cellular towers to help combat LTE interference issues.\n\nThe CompassMPL app is integrated into the ComSonics’ GENACIS Web application and is therefore capable of interacting with signal leakage data already stored. Using this tool, the user can also customize their problem found and resolution code lists to match their individual preferences.  Export file capability is provided for each utility via the web interface.\n\nA demo mode is provided to introduce the operation of the CompassMPL. Upon entering into a subscription service with ComSonics and connecting with ComSonics GENACIS server, the application status will change to the live version with full interactivity. The subscription service limits each user to two simultaneous active devices; however, the user can add other devices by deactivating one of the two active devices.  \n\nThe customer is required to contact ComSonics Customer Service to begin the CompassMPL subscription service.  After customer signup, the Web application will need to be set up to authenticate potential users of the service.  An administrator will need to enter in their user names and passwords that will then be used for their login authentication for the CompassMPL application.  Failure to authenticate will disallow connection.\n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.", "bundleId":"com.comsonics.mpl", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "genreIds":["6000", "6007"]},
