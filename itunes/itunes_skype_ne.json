"description":"Skype keeps the world talking. Say “hello” with an instant message, voice or video call – all for free*, no matter what device they use Skype on. Skype is available on phones, tablets, PCs and Macs.\n\n• Video calls – Don’t just hear the cheers, see them! Get together with 1 or 24 of your friends and family on a HD video call. Watch everyone’s smiles and cries when you tell them “We’re engaged!!!” \n• Chat – Reach people instantly. Send messages to your friends, grab someone’s attention with @ mentions or create a group chat to plan a family reunion. \n• Share – Send photos and videos with your family and friends. Save shared photos and videos to your camera roll. Share your screen to make travel plans with friends or present designs to your team.\n• Voice calls – Camera shy? Make voice calls to anyone in the world on Skype. You can also call mobile and landlines at low rates.\n• Express yourself – Liven up conversations with emoticons, click on the “+” in chat to send a Giphy or images from the web, and annotate images with words, lines and more.\n\n*Skype to Skype calls are free. Operator data charges may apply. We recommend using an unlimited data plan or WiFi connection.\n\nCall landline and device numbers and send SMS messages anywhere in the world at affordable prices using Skype. Reach non-Skype users or contacts who are not online by choosing Skype Credit or Skype subscriptions. \n \nChoose Skype Credit as a pay-as-you-go option to call and SMS. If you call specific destinations, save even more with monthly subscriptions. Skype subscriptions are monthly calling plans that let you make unlimited, or fixed-minute calls to landlines (and mobiles where applicable). Subscriptions begin at $2.99 a month for US, and can vary by destination. To make an in-app purchase, open the app, go to the Call tab and tap on the Skype to Phone banner. Skype Credit and Subscriptions purchased from the Skype app will be charged to your iTunes account when the purchase has been confirmed.\n \nYour account will be charged for Skype subscription renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. Your subscription is renewed automatically unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period of subscription.\n \nYou can manage your subscription by going to your Apple ID account settings and choosing the auto-renewal option or turning it off at any time after your purchase.\n \n• Privacy and Cookies policy: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=507539\n• Microsoft Services Agreement: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=530144", "bundleId":"com.skype.skype", "releaseDate":"2010-02-18T15:31:21Z", "primaryGenreName":"Social Networking", "primaryGenreId":6005, "userRatingCount":11, "averageUserRating":4.0},

VPN Express does exactly what, when, & how I need it for a very reasonable price. Best one out there!\"\n\n+++++ Jan 22, 2012 by Neil.D\n\"100% Perfect. 100% of the Time - This is the best VPN solution I have used. It's on my Mac, iPad and iPhone and can be used simultaneously!

Recommended.\"\n\n+++++ Oct 17, 2011 by Computer Bear\n\"VPN Express - This app is great. Skype was blocked at the hospital where my son was in the NICU. My family and friends could not always travel the 150 mile round trip with us to see the baby. The hospitals IT director was asked to unblock Skype several times. He would not. With this app I went around the firewall. I highly recommend this app.\"", "bundleId":"com.bestsparks.vpnclient", "releaseDate":"2010-07-31T07:00:00Z", "primaryGenreName":"Productivity", "primaryGenreId":6007},

"description":"A smarter way to book a taxi! Book your cab with Skype to avoid the expense. Use SMS booking to save money and avoid language barriers when abroad. If we can't give you such options, plain old phone booking is of course available.\n\n*** Abroad and not having internet connection? \nWhere possible, Taxican will give you a choice of providers from its on-device database (60+ cities worldwide, growing every day) with hopefully SMS option to book.\n\n*** Have internet connection, but we don't have on-device provider handy?  \nUse built-in online search for a taxi, to book just in two taps. Stores the taxicab you found for you, so you can use it next time, either you are connected or not.\n\n*** Your favorite taxi is not in the online search or on-device list?\nJust add it. All of the booking options, phone, skype, sms are available here to use if provider supports them. No need to approve anything with anyone here. If you like sharing your favorite provider with others and Taxican team, please do. Within a day we add it, so all Taxican users can use it.\n\n*** In a restaurant/office and gps is not really helpful finding your pickup address?\nTaxican integrates with Foursquare to bring you the list of pickup location candidates closest to you. You bet there is a chance the restaurant or your office will be on the list, thus giving you and a taxi driver a perfect pickup address.\n\n*** Booked for few days in advance and can't remember if booked or for when and with whom exactly?\nHistory of last 10 bookings is kept for your convenience. With pickup location if entered, pickup time, taxi provider name and city, just in case! As we are getting older at Taxican this becomes our favorite feature :).\n\n*** A word of disclaimer and encouragement\nWe will try to do our best to find your a taxi with the least expense and hurdle. Though we are just starting and your suggestions for new taxis and improvements will be greatly appreciated.", "bundleId":"com.taxican.taxiglobal", "releaseDate":"2011-08-02T12:07:07Z", "primaryGenreName":"Travel", "primaryGenreId":6003},

"description":"QUICK SEARCH AND SET OF CONTACTS\nNew utility ICaller from KiraLine Inc is a modern search engine that you can use to very quickly find the person you want and dial his number, irrespective of how large your notebook is. Therefore, this program is particularly useful when driving and when traffic on the road is very slow. Now you just need to type two or three numbers or letters and the utility would display the list of matches, and only need to lightly touch the screen to call the person.\n\nT9 SYSTEM FOR YOUR IPHONE\nYou can search for a contact through the T9 system, which is one of the most popular among mobile phone users around the world. With the T9 system, you type a word, focusing on the keys, each of which has 4-5 letters. Thus, the typing speed increases, while the smart program picks up the word you are looking for.\n\nTWO WORDS IN ONE SEARCH\nWe all come across common names. For example, my phonebook contains 15 people answering Sergeyev, who have different surnames or belong to different aspects of my life. In one of the latest updates, the iCaller developers designed the search system for two words. Use the button \"1\" for additional filtering of contacts.\n\nFAST SMS MESSAGES, AND REMOVAL OF CONTACTS FROM CALL HISTORY\nOur application features maximum functionality at a time and this is of paramount importance to us. You can send SMS from the main screen by swiping your finger over the contact: swiping it in one direction sends SMS, swiping to the other direction deletes a contact from the call history. The same operation is also available from the dial string.\n\nFAVORITE CONTACTS – SELECTED FEATURES\nThe ICaller utility is fully integrated with the phone book, in which you can add and edit contacts, and create a list of up to 50 favorite contacts for speed dialing, adding the photo of a loved one or colleague to the name. You can interchange the position of contact icons, add new ones and instantly dial a number or send an SMS message.\n\nFINE TUNING THE UTILITY FOR YOUR TASTE \nThe program supports advanced options you can use to customize iCaller for yourself. Here, you can enable/disable the sound and tips, and delete call history. In the settings, you can select the priority search by name or surname. This is especially important where two-word search is possible. Screen settings would enable you select the background of the screen, choose the main contact number or display a list to choose from and select the type of image - icons with photos or name of the contact. You can also select the main screen at startup - Favorites or keyboard for searching and dialing a contact.\n\nICALLER SUPPORTS THE MAJOR LANGUAGES OF THE WORLD \nIn the settings, you can choose the primary and secondary language. Note that iCaller supports 5 languages.

"description":"Boost your iPhone with CallingCredit!\n\n\n- Cheap or even FREE calls to countries across the world!\n- Easy to use!\n- Perfect sound quality!\n\nCallingCredit will help you save dramatically on your international calls, without changing the way you use your iPhone. \n\nHow does CallingCredit achieve this? Well, CallingCredit for iPhone allows your phone to access the CallingCredit system through a local access number. If you have a contract with your mobile operator, calls to the CallingCredit access number will be included within your regular monthly calling plan. If you are a pay-as-you go customer, your mobile operator will only charge you the cost of a local call. \n\nOnce your call has reached the CallingCredit access number, CallingCredit takes care of connecting the call at incredibly low rates.   \n\nTo benefit from the CallingCredit system, you need to have your mobile phone number listed in your CallingCredit account. \n\nIf you do not have an account, sign up here: http://www.callingcredit.com\n\nCallingCredit website \nhttp://www.callingcredit.com\n\nContact CallingCredit Support \nsupport@callingcredit.com", "bundleId":"com.5Pro-Software.CallingCredit", "releaseDate":"2010-04-30T18:29:29Z", "primaryGenreName":"Utilities", "primaryGenreId":6002},

"description":"Do you use WhatsApp, Viber, Telegram, SMS, Skype or other messenger program? Then check out this app. With it you can send a message written by one of these applications, but talking about! You said, it turns into text and then you choose who to send. Great for anyone who has difficulty writing in small keyboard phone or prefer talking instead of typing.\n\nIf you do not want or do not like to use the keyboard, this app assists in this task when it comes to sending messages through messenger programs.\n\nYou talk, evaluates which of the options is correct phrase phrases (you can change the text) and touch to send the text by default program that you set the general settings. You can change this option each shipment by choosing another application for shipment. Just choose the contact or group from your messenger and ready program. Your text message is sent.\n\nThe phrase can be recognized easily completed at the end with a question mark (?), An exclamation point (!) Or with an ellipsis (...). Just tap the corresponding icon shipping. This facilitates the understanding of the meaning of the phrase, very simply.\n\nAllows you to set the language for the speech to be recognized (Portuguese, English, Spanish, Arabic, French and others), independently of the language of presentation of the screens.\n\nIt allows you to send your geographic location with a link to the maps, along with your message. Thus, the person who receives your message will know where you are. Because it is an item that exposes privacy, you must enable this function and confirm sending each message.\n\nYou can also create phrases and leave them stored for later sending. Thus, frequent use of phrases are ready to quickly send to clients, friends, suppliers, etc.\n\nNew: You now has to \"speak camouflaged\": you register text for specific words replacements. So you can say something and send a different text!\n\nImportant: You need to have the desired messenger program installed on your device. This application does not replace the official messenger program. The names of the above messengers are owned by third parties and have no connection with these companies.", "bundleId":"com.hamiltonhtsnet.com.br.faleparabatepapo", "releaseDate":"2016-02-19T01:54:24Z", "primaryGenreName":"Productivity", "primaryGenreId":6007},

"description":"**UPDATE** PocketCam now supports audio! Support for FaceTime, iChat/Messages on macs added!\n\n** YouTube Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A69c4HHok3U\n\n** IMPORTANT ** Please turn off Bluetooth on the device (Settings->General->Bluetooth) before using PocketCam. Otherwise, you may experience frame drops/freeze. \n\nWhy paying for an expensive webcam when you can use your awesome iOS device for video conference?  Better yet, your iOS webcam is wireless!  Now you can use your iOS device to show around your house/apartment on your favorite webcam applications such as FaceTime, iChat/Messages, Windows Live or Skype.\n\nPocketCam lets you use your iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad as a wireless webcam (and microphone!) for your Windows-based computer or Mac (OS X 10.7 or above). PocketCam automatically forwards video captured by your iOS camera, which can then be used as if they come from a virtual webcam.\n\nPocketCam works with any Windows-based webcam or video conferencing applications, including instant message applications such as MSN Live Messenger, Skype, AIM, etc.  For Mac users, PocketCam works with any Mac applications that use QuickTime for video capturing, including FaceTime, iChat/Messages, GTalk, Skype and aMSN.\n\nYou can even record the live video from your iOS cam using a webcam recorder such as QuickTime Pro.\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1.  If you have not already done so, download and install the PocketControl for Windows or Mac software from our website: http://www.senstic.com/iPhone/PocketCam/PocketCam.aspx\n\n2.  On Windows, run PocketControl for Windows and make sure the PocketCam service is running on your computer.  On Mac, run PocketControl, and run any application that uses webcam and select PocketCam as your preferred webcam.\n\n3.  Start PocketCam on iOS device, and the app will automatically connect to your computer. The bottom of your iOS screen should display \"Connected to your_computer_name:port.\"\n\n4.  Start any program on your computer that uses webcam, and select \"PocketCam\" as your virtual webcam.\n\nEnjoy live feed from your iOS camera as your webcam source!\n\nStep-by-step instructions can be found at http://www.senstic.com/iphone/pocketcam/Support.aspx\n\nLIMITATIONS:\n\n1.  Currently, PocketCam supports Windows XP/Vista/7/8, Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) or above.\n\n2.  There is a half second delay before the images are shown up on the computer.\n\n\n*** If you have problem getting PocketCam to work, please contact us at support@senstic.com, and we will help you fix the problem.", "bundleId":"com.yourcompany.CamSource", "releaseDate":"2010-02-18T17:20:34Z", "primaryGenreName":"Utilities", "primaryGenreId":6002},
