The Apple Remote would cost a significant amount. Add ANOTHER hit to your wallet for a wireless control like a keyboard, mouse, or the Apple Magic Trackpad!\n\nYou carry your iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad wherever you go… so why should you carry a second device just to control your computer? Furthermore, why should you need line-of-sight to do so?\n\nEnter Rowmote Pro! Rowmote Pro is like your Mac’s remote control, but over the wireless network and even better! Trackpad and keyboard give you complete control over your computer, and you can control, launch, and quit apps, toggle the iTunes Visualizer, and more without ever having to squint at your screen. Rowmote is Mac-like from the ground up.\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Control your Mac completely over a wireless network. No line of sight necessary.\n\n- Works like the hardware Apple Remote Control in:\n• Adobe Lightroom\n• Airfoil Video\n• Amarra\n• Aperture\n• BBC iPlayer\n• Beamer\n• Boxee\n• Decibel\n• DVD Player\n• Ecoute\n• eyeTV 3.x\n• Firefox\n• Front Row\n• Hulu Desktop\n• iPhoto\n• iTunes\n• Keynote ‘08 & later\n• kJams Pro\n• Kodi\n• Last.fm\n• Logic\n• Microsoft Powerpoint ‘04 & later\n• mPlayer\n• Movist\n• OpenOffice Impress\n• Preview\n• PandoraBoy\n• PandoraJam\n• PandoraOne Desktop\n• Photos\n• Plex, Plex Home Theater, & Plex Media Player\n• Quicktime\n• Rdio\n• Safari\n• Skim\n• Songbird\n• Spotify\n• Squire\n• The Tube\n• VLC\n• xbmc (Xbox Media Center)\n\nPRO CONTROL: A single tap switches to the keyboard & trackpad mode.\n- Portrait & landscape\n- True multitouch: Scroll with two fingers, right click, drag, pinch to zoom, and swipe with 3 or 4 fingers.\n- Tap anywhere or use the virtual button\n- Keyboard includes extended characters, modifier keys, function keys, numeric pad, brightness control, and more\n- Multiple monitor support\n\n- SWITCH: Access your Mac’s Dock; launch & switch between all controllable applications on the Mac; toggle the iTunes visualizer; and more.\n\n- Sleep & wake as needed (wireless waking requires Mac OS X 10.6+).\n- Innovative Gesture Pad for no-look control over menu-driven applications like Plex and Hulu Desktop\n- Pause the music or video automatically when you answer a call on your iPhone\n- Proximity sensor support to automatically turn the screen off if the device is face-down\n- Secure authentication\n- Connect via WiFi or Bluetooth (Bluetooth requires Personal Hotspot Bluetooth tethering)\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\n • Mac OS X 10.4.0 or later: The free Rowmote Helper program must be running on the Mac. Download at www.rowmote.com. Some features require Leopard (10.5) or later; some gestures require Lion (10.7) or later.\n • Apple TV: 1st gen/2nd gen only may see www.rowmote.com/atv for potential compatibility.\n\nRowmote Pro is the only app you need to control your computer.

So what if anybody can do the same with only a little effort? Maybe the playlist you build could be astonishing and you will be the next DJ in Tomorrowland!\n\nYou will have two new features for Spotify:\n\nThe first one is helping you to find great playlists that already exists and if you want to follow them you can directly from the app.\n\nThe second one is helping you to create awesome playlists based on the playlists you love. We've build a \"bot\" that do the hard work for you. So this is the idea:\n\n* You create a new playlist or use an existing one.\n* Then, you synchronize to this playlists other playlists you love or follow.\n* Once you have some playlists you thing that are great, the bot will copy them to your own playlist every 15 minutes. In other words, each time that a playlist you love adds a song, it will be automatically added to your playlist.\n\nWhy this will help me? Because you will be able to delete the songs you don't like and the \"bot\" will add every song you may love because of the other playlists.\n\nThis will save you a lot of time to create your best playlist ever and share it in the social media!\n\n\n*** Please note: This app is not affiliated with Spotify but It’s required to have an account of Spotify to use the app.", "bundleId":"com.danigil.megaplaylists", "releaseDate":"2018-02-22T00:23:14Z", "primaryGenreName":"Music", "primaryGenreId":6011},

"description":"JOIN THE PLAYLIST !\nDecide the music together\n\nWaveUp is the coolest collaborative playlist application. It allows you to decide what music is played at parties, instantly and from your phone.\n\n● How does it work?\nAll you have to do is create a room by giving it a name and an emoji code. You can then invite your friends to join it so that together you can add your music.\nThe coolest thing: Everyone can enjoy their favorite music and bring it up to the top of the playlist! The most liked song will be played first!\n\n● Where does the music come from?\nThe person who creates a room must sign in to a premium Spotify account to enable music addition. Don't have one? Let a Spotify subscriber create the room. You can then join it, add music and like or dislike the songs in the room. WaveUp will soon be available with Deezer and Apple Music.\n\nFollow us !\nFacebook: WaveUp\nInstagram: waveupapp\nTwitter: @waveupapp", "bundleId":"com.nolane.waveup-app", "releaseDate":"2019-03-14T13:38:33Z", "primaryGenreName":"Music", "primaryGenreId":6011},

"description":"\"Hook is exactly what the doctor ordered. Many apps came close but you nailed it.\" —DJ puzzle\n\n\"Hook is definitely the most fun I've had making music on iOS.  The sampling options are vast and the editing is intuitive.  It's connectivity and versatility makes it a powerful performance tool and production sketchbook.\" — Starkey\n\n5 STARS \"Most impressive DJ mashup & sampler / editor I've seen on iOS so far! It's like the best of all other apps combined in one and all of the latest developments integrated like recording or importing ur own music and inter-app audio.\" — App Store Review\n\n====\nThis is the free iPhone version of Hook. There's also an iPad version for 13 bucks. The feature sets are identical, but the iPad version is optimized for the larger screen, including iPad Pro. The iPad version also comes with 4 additional sound packs with over 500 samples.\n====\n\nHook is a new music performance, mashup, and DJ app for iPhone and iPad. Arrange and trigger loops on a grid and create dynamic, expressive transitions with the Flux Fader — a multitouch \"smart crossfader\" that allows you to expressively make transitions between any combination of tracks/cells on the fly. The Flux Fader includes a two-axis control with 9 riser synths, glitch and gate effects, tempo-synced filter sweeps, an EQ, beat drop, tape stop, and filter drop. Combining all these to make transitions is the heart of playing live with Hook. Hook includes a full editor complete with auto transient slicing and waveform editing. Tight integration with AudioCopy makes it easy to drop in your own loops and sounds from other apps.\n\nReal creative power can be found in the integrated sampler — record from mic/line, other apps via inter-app audio, and grab hooks from iTunes and Spotify. Change tempo in real time, and keep all your hooks in sync. Hook is a killer mashup tool with a full mixer, tons of tracks, integrated FX bus, per-cell fx, transpose, time stretching, tuning, timing and trigger settings, and more. Imagine the clip launching capabilities of Ableton Live in a futuristic multitouch environment.\n\n====\nExtend Hook with Wej!\nWej is an iOS music hub that combines a non-skid performance base with integrated lightshow and wireless MIDI for up to two controllers — all while keeping your iOS device charged.
