"description":"Skype keeps the world talking. Say “hello” with an instant message, voice or video call – all for free*, no matter what device they use Skype on. Skype is available on phones, tablets, PCs and Macs.\n\n• Video calls – Don’t just hear the cheers, see them! Get together with 1 or 24 of your friends and family on a HD video call. Watch everyone’s smiles and cries when you tell them “We’re engaged!!!” \n• Chat – Reach people instantly. Send messages to your friends, grab someone’s attention with @ mentions or create a group chat to plan a family reunion. \n• Share – Send photos and videos with your family and friends. Save shared photos and videos to your camera roll. Share your screen to make travel plans with friends or present designs to your team.\n• Voice calls – Camera shy? Make voice calls to anyone in the world on Skype. You can also call mobile and landlines at low rates.\n• Express yourself – Liven up conversations with emoticons, click on the “+” in chat to send a Giphy or images from the web, and annotate images with words, lines and more.\n\n*Skype to Skype calls are free. Operator data charges may apply. We recommend using an unlimited data plan or WiFi connection.\n\nCall landline and device numbers and send SMS messages anywhere in the world at affordable prices using Skype. Reach non-Skype users or contacts who are not online by choosing Skype Credit or Skype subscriptions. \n \nChoose Skype Credit as a pay-as-you-go option to call and SMS. If you call specific destinations, save even more with monthly subscriptions. Skype subscriptions are monthly calling plans that let you make unlimited, or fixed-minute calls to landlines (and mobiles where applicable). Subscriptions begin at $2.99 a month for US, and can vary by destination. To make an in-app purchase, open the app, go to the Call tab and tap on the Skype to Phone banner. Skype Credit and Subscriptions purchased from the Skype app will be charged to your iTunes account when the purchase has been confirmed.\n \nYour account will be charged for Skype subscription renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. Your subscription is renewed automatically unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period of subscription.\n \nYou can manage your subscription by going to your Apple ID account settings and choosing the auto-renewal option or turning it off at any time after your purchase.\n \n• Privacy and Cookies policy: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=507539\n• Microsoft Services Agreement: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=530144", "currency":"USD", "bundleId":"com.skype.skype", "minimumOsVersion":"10.0", "releaseNotes":"We're listening to your feedback and working hard to improve Skype.

"description":"+++300MB VPN data for FREE!+++Best Online Game Accelerator+++Access VOIP & Facebook, YouTube, Hulu, Skype, Instagram, SnapChat, Netflix smoothly!+++Auto-setup all your devices (iPhone, iPad, iTouch)+++Servers in United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, France, Hong Kong and Germany!\n\nWHAT IS IT?\nVPN is a 128-bit encrypted tunnel between your device (computer, iPhone/iTouch/iPad) and one of our servers.\n\nWHY HAVE A VPN ACCOUNT?\nIf you want a total Internet traffic anonymizing experience, a VPN account is the best way to go - there’s no IP numbers to configure into the webapps, and no software to install - just set up the VPN and it’s done! Other features include, but are not limited to:\n\n- Use VOIP service from anywhere\n- Accelerate online games: get extremely low latency when playing Order & Chaos, MetalStorm online and etc.\n- Assigns your computer a new IP address, hides your real IP to anonymize all web applications.\n- A secure encrypted connection between your computer and the Internet.\n- Secure your wireless (Wi-Fi) connection at home or at public Hotspots.\n- Unlike a proxy, you get secured connection for all programs you are using, (e.g ICQ, Email, FTP, News and anything that uses a Internet Connection)\n\nWHY USE VPN EXPRESS FOR YOUR VPN SERVICES?\n- Support All VPN Protocols available in iOS devices: IPSec, L2TP over IPSec and PPTP!\n- Lowest Rates with 24x7 availability! 99% service up time! Beat any other competitors in market!\n- Optimized for iPhone/iPad/iTouch communication\n- Quality Network ensures your VPN service will be fast wherever you are in the world\n\nWHAT OUR CUSTOMERS SAY:\n+++++ Mar 2, 2012 by DrRhysB\n\"Excellent App! - I had tried several VPN plans before this & wasn't satisfied with the through-put consistency. VPN Express does exactly what, when, & how I need it for a very reasonable price. Best one out there!\"\n\n+++++ Jan 22, 2012 by Neil.D\n\"100% Perfect. 100% of the Time - This is the best VPN solution I have used. It's on my Mac, iPad and iPhone and can be used simultaneously! The pricing plans are awesome as well. Saves me a bundle.\"\n\n+++++ Jan 11, 2012 by Anthony Martinez\n\"Simple, efficient VPN. It just works. - Very easy to use with auto-configure setting. I use this all the time, and find it is great when traveling internationally or when I want greater wifi security in coffee shops. Recommended.\"\n\n+++++ Oct 17, 2011 by Computer Bear\n\"VPN Express - This app is great. Skype was blocked at the hospital where my son was in the NICU. My family and friends could not always travel the 150 mile round trip with us to see the baby. The hospitals IT director was asked to unblock Skype several times. He would not. With this app I went around the firewall. I highly recommend this app.\"", "currency":"USD", "bundleId":"com.bestsparks.vpnclient", "minimumOsVersion":"6.0", "releaseNotes":"Bug fixes", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2016-08-31T11:40:33Z"},

"description":"A smarter way to book a taxi! Book your cab with Skype to avoid the expense. Use SMS booking to save money and avoid language barriers when abroad. If we can't give you such options, plain old phone booking is of course available.\n\n*** Abroad and not having internet connection? \nWhere possible, Taxican will give you a choice of providers from its on-device database (60+ cities worldwide, growing every day) with hopefully SMS option to book.\n\n*** Have internet connection, but we don't have on-device provider handy?  \nUse built-in online search for a taxi, to book just in two taps. Stores the taxicab you found for you, so you can use it next time, either you are connected or not.\n\n*** Your favorite taxi is not in the online search or on-device list?\nJust add it. All of the booking options, phone, skype, sms are available here to use if provider supports them. No need to approve anything with anyone here. If you like sharing your favorite provider with others and Taxican team, please do. Within a day we add it, so all Taxican users can use it.\n\n*** In a restaurant/office and gps is not really helpful finding your pickup address?\nTaxican integrates with Foursquare to bring you the list of pickup location candidates closest to you. You bet there is a chance the restaurant or your office will be on the list, thus giving you and a taxi driver a perfect pickup address.\n\n*** Booked for few days in advance and can't remember if booked or for when and with whom exactly?\nHistory of last 10 bookings is kept for your convenience. With pickup location if entered, pickup time, taxi provider name and city, just in case! As we are getting older at Taxican this becomes our favorite feature :).\n\n*** A word of disclaimer and encouragement\nWe will try to do our best to find your a taxi with the least expense and hurdle.

"releaseNotes":"+++ Now you can add your own city/region or let Taxican add it for you based on your address. Once it is added, providers assigned to it are going to stay (sorry it didn't work well before).\n+++ Providers search in suburbs and unknown to Taxican cities is greatly improved. If there is a known city nearby, Taxican will offer you providers from there.\n*** Though many more features are planned, the next release is going to be about responsiveness and reliability. \n*** See our blog for what is coming.\n*** We will do our best to bring correct sms/text booking in Australia and Singapore. Working on it!\n??? Have a text/sms number for taxi booking in your city? Please share!", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2012-06-03T16:00:25Z"},

"description":"QUICK SEARCH AND SET OF CONTACTS\nNew utility ICaller from KiraLine Inc is a modern search engine that you can use to very quickly find the person you want and dial his number, irrespective of how large your notebook is. Therefore, this program is particularly useful when driving and when traffic on the road is very slow. Now you just need to type two or three numbers or letters and the utility would display the list of matches, and only need to lightly touch the screen to call the person.\n\nT9 SYSTEM FOR YOUR IPHONE\nYou can search for a contact through the T9 system, which is one of the most popular among mobile phone users around the world. With the T9 system, you type a word, focusing on the keys, each of which has 4-5 letters. Thus, the typing speed increases, while the smart program picks up the word you are looking for.\n\nTWO WORDS IN ONE SEARCH\nWe all come across common names. For example, my phonebook contains 15 people answering Sergeyev, who have different surnames or belong to different aspects of my life. In one of the latest updates, the iCaller developers designed the search system for two words. Use the button \"1\" for additional filtering of contacts.\n\nFAST SMS MESSAGES, AND REMOVAL OF CONTACTS FROM CALL HISTORY\nOur application features maximum functionality at a time and this is of paramount importance to us. You can send SMS from the main screen by swiping your finger over the contact: swiping it in one direction sends SMS, swiping to the other direction deletes a contact from the call history. The same operation is also available from the dial string.\n\nFAVORITE CONTACTS – SELECTED FEATURES\nThe ICaller utility is fully integrated with the phone book, in which you can add and edit contacts, and create a list of up to 50 favorite contacts for speed dialing, adding the photo of a loved one or colleague to the name. You can interchange the position of contact icons, add new ones and instantly dial a number or send an SMS message.\n\nFINE TUNING THE UTILITY FOR YOUR TASTE \nThe program supports advanced options you can use to customize iCaller for yourself. Here, you can enable/disable the sound and tips, and delete call history. In the settings, you can select the priority search by name or surname. This is especially important where two-word search is possible. Screen settings would enable you select the background of the screen, choose the main contact number or display a list to choose from and select the type of image - icons with photos or name of the contact. You can also select the main screen at startup - Favorites or keyboard for searching and dialing a contact.\n\nICALLER SUPPORTS THE MAJOR LANGUAGES OF THE WORLD \nIn the settings, you can choose the primary and secondary language. Note that iCaller supports 5 languages. You can search in Latin and Cyrillic alphabets.\n\nWe welcome your suggestions and feedback at info@kiraline.com.\n\nPlease often go to our official Facebook page for new games and applications!\nwww.facebook.com/kiralineinc", "currency":"USD", "bundleId":"com.Kiraline.iCaller", "minimumOsVersion":"8.0", "releaseNotes":"- Some bugs fixed;", "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2018-08-07T14:21:10Z"},
