"description":"\"Hook is exactly what the doctor ordered. Many apps came close but you nailed it.\" —DJ puzzle\n\n\"Hook is definitely the most fun I've had making music on iOS.  The sampling options are vast and the editing is intuitive.  It's connectivity and versatility makes it a powerful performance tool and production sketchbook.\" — Starkey\n\n5 STARS \"Most impressive DJ mashup & sampler / editor I've seen on iOS so far! It's like the best of all other apps combined in one and all of the latest developments integrated like recording or importing ur own music and inter-app audio.\" — App Store Review\n\n====\nThis is the free iPhone version of Hook. There's also an iPad version for 13 bucks. The feature sets are identical, but the iPad version is optimized for the larger screen, including iPad Pro. The iPad version also comes with 4 additional sound packs with over 500 samples.\n====\n\nHook is a new music performance, mashup, and DJ app for iPhone and iPad. Arrange and trigger loops on a grid and create dynamic, expressive transitions with the Flux Fader — a multitouch \"smart crossfader\" that allows you to expressively make transitions between any combination of tracks/cells on the fly. The Flux Fader includes a two-axis control with 9 riser synths, glitch and gate effects, tempo-synced filter sweeps, an EQ, beat drop, tape stop, and filter drop. Combining all these to make transitions is the heart of playing live with Hook. Hook includes a full editor complete with auto transient slicing and waveform editing. Tight integration with AudioCopy makes it easy to drop in your own loops and sounds from other apps.\n\nReal creative power can be found in the integrated sampler — record from mic/line, other apps via inter-app audio, and grab hooks from iTunes and Spotify. Change tempo in real time, and keep all your hooks in sync. Hook is a killer mashup tool with a full mixer, tons of tracks, integrated FX bus, per-cell fx, transpose, time stretching, tuning, timing and trigger settings, and more. Imagine the clip launching capabilities of Ableton Live in a futuristic multitouch environment.\n\n====\nExtend Hook with Wej!\nWej is an iOS music hub that combines a non-skid performance base with integrated lightshow and wireless MIDI for up to two controllers — all while keeping your iOS device charged.

"description":"Run longer, faster, and stronger with PaceDJ, the only app that modifies music BPMs to match your running pace AND allows you to create interval workouts.  There is no better running music app – Period. Get it now!\n\nRECOMMENDED BY:\n•New York Times\n•Washington Post\n•Health Magazine\n•Runner’s World \n•Men’s Health\n•Women’s Health\n•RealSimple\n•And more!\n\nWHY WE’RE BETTER THAN OTHER APPS\n\n•We're Personalized: PaceDJ lets you use the songs you have saved in your iTunes library.  This means you are in control of your playlists.  Other services provide random playlists created by DJs who don't know your tastes.  \n\n•We're Precise: Some apps claim they can serve songs at BPMs to pace you to a specific minute/mile time.  Unless they know your stride length, they can't do this accurately.   PaceDJ helps you find the right BPM first, and then fine tune to match your mile time goal.  \n\n•We're Free! Try PaceDJ for free to see how you like it!  Then upgrade to Premium for features including intervals training, dislike button, and remove ads.  \n\n•We're Unique: PaceDJ is the ONLY APP that speeds up or slows down BPMs to match your running pace AND allows you to create interval workouts.   \n\n•Like Intervals?  We've got that! Create custom interval workouts or choose from pre-programmed templates.\n\n•Each song you own can pace you at multiple levels – a massive increase in the usefulness of your music library\n\n•PaceDJ.com provides a FREE music discovery service so you can find and purchase songs that match your running pace.\n\n•Echonest song database has over 35million songs and 2.8 million artists.\n\n•Easily correct BPMs by tapping on the drum. \n\nUSER REVIEWS: \n•\"I love this app, I use it to crank up speed work for marathon training without my pace conflicting with my music!\"\n\n•\"PaceDJ allowed me to find tunes that helped me pace myself… and spend my energy focusing on…proper running form. I use PaceDJ on every run.\"\n\n•\"PaceDJ gives me that extra boost of motivation. It gives me the proper speeds I need to stay on pace and even ramp up my speed work.\"\n\nON THE WEB AT WWW.PACEDJ.COM\n\nTECHNICAL INFORMATION\nv2.0 requires iOS9.0 and higher.\n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background in PaceDJ can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE:\ncustomerservice@pacedj.com\n\n\nTHIS APP AND ANY INFORMATION GIVEN BY IT ARE NOT INTENDED NOR IMPLIED TO BE A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL ADVICE.

"description":"This game's for kids is an application for pre-school & kindergarten kids who are in early stage of identifying and learning to write English alphabets. This application helps children to memorize and learn to write in three stages:  \nObserve and memorize: In this step, kids learn letter writing flow and directions with pleasing animations.   \nObserve and trace : In this step, kids learn to write letters by tracing a guiding animation on letters.   \n   \nABC Fruits is more than just a kid-friendly educational app, it was designed with adult participation in mind, too. The interface keeps toddlers focused on alphabet reading and writing, tucking menu commands away from moving fingers. Adults can easily access settings to engage Teacher Mode, look at report cards, or toggle tracing and phonics games to better facilitate learning. \n  \nFEATURES \n•\tShow and enforce how to write letters correctly\n•\tLearn to write uppercase alphabet letters\n•\tShapes tracing activity for toddlers\n•\tBright, colorful graphics\n•\tBeautiful cartoon animation of animals", "bundleId":"com.jansee.abcgame.dinosaurs17", "trackId":1192974849},
