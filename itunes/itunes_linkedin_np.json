"description":"Eight is the ultimate business card organizer and professional networking platform. Used by over 2 million people, Eight is an easy, convenient & completely free-to-use app.\n\nSimply scan in any visiting cards you receive, and see them instantly put into a digital business cards holder. Eight uses a proprietary combination of OCR technology & human input to accurately digitize each card into a unique Eight profile, giving users a convenient database of their professional network with 99.9% accuracy!\n\nEight is also a powerful professional network and enables you to network with scanned business cards on the app. From a contact's profile, you can call, email, or view their address on a map. Eight users can share news & updates with their Eight network or even interact with each other through instant messages. \n\nWhy Eight?\n-\tIt scans business cards with 99.9% accuracy using both OCR & human transcription thus helping users to manage contacts and stay linked in conveniently and easily.\n-\tThe standard version is free and includes scanning, organizing features. \n-\tUsers can purchase Eight Premium for quicker digitization and more benefits.\n-\tUsers can sync their networks to their devices. Data is also automatically updated if connected contacts change the details on their business card.\n\nWhat Eight has in store for you:\n\n- Organize business cards & professional networks: \nUsers often have a large stack of disorganized visiting cards & biz cards making them difficult to use and refer to. Eight is a free digital card holder that solves this problem by removing the need for manual entry. Now using your mobile cam, cards will be instantly digitized into an e visiting card, and you will be able to see full information of the card on the app. Additionally, once digitized, Eight lets users add notes & tags on profiles so they can manage contacts & organize their business & professional network efficiently. It's a digital card scanner, holder, reader & organizer consolidated in a single app.\n\n- Manual input to ensure superior accuracy: \nEight uses a combination of OCR technology & human resources to digitize business cards from a scanned image into a digital Eight profile. After users scan their biz cards, Eight uses OCR technology to instantly read the data on the visiting cards, which is then manually checked & corrected by our team, ensuring 99.9% accuracy even for the most hard-to-read cards. It's a perfect digital card maker as it easily converts visiting cards to e biz cards.\n\n- Easy search feature to find & reach contacts from within the app: \nThis is not your regular visiting cards scanner or digital business card holder. It allows users to manage contacts & contact them via email or phone, helping them unlock new business & career opportunities. It is especially helpful for salespeople and salesforce users to manage & convert leads.\n\n- Free to use basic app with an option to buy premium features: \nThe standard version of the app is free to use and has all the essential functions that make Eight a powerful business solution. Users can purchase Eight Premium for additional benefits including an ability to export their data (e.g. phonebook sync). It not only helps users to convert their visiting cards & biz cards into e business cards using OCR but also lets them export their e business card data to their devices.\n\n- Networking: Eight stands out among others as it not only scans your business cards but also lets you stay linked in with your contacts who are themselves Eight users, by providing options such as private instant chat messaging and an activity feed thus providing you with ample business opportunities and timely updates from your network.\n\nHow does Eight compare to alternatives?\nCamcard: Camcard and most other scanners only uses OCR, not human input, causing significantly lower accuracy.\nBric: Bric and others have scan limits, following which you have to pay. Eight is totally free and unlimited.", "bundleId":"net.8card.eight", "trackId":444423637, "genreIds":["6000", "6002"], "formattedPrice":"Free", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "sellerName":"Sansan, Inc.", "minimumOsVersion":"10.0"},

"description":"Your network is one of your most valuable assets. At its full potential, it can unlock a whole world of opportunities.

For conference organisers, attendees find live networking opportunities through immediate matching and browsing, so they can meet, converse and exchange value in minutes.  For everyone else, Kalido removes the middleman, and replaces anonymous reviews with trusted recommendations.\n\nKalido acts as your marketplace for people.  It will find you an awesome local web designer, it will allow you to introduce your friend, who is a freelance photographer, to your private trusted network of local entrepreneurs.

It will do all of this, perpetually, infinitely, daily. For free.\n\nWe believe that there should be a level playing field and people should have the environment to create opportunity for themselves no matter who they are.  That’s why we built Kalido.\n\n● Nearby: You are surrounded by talented individuals who can offer useful skills, and Kalido can help you discover them.

Perhaps your friend is a freelance photographer? Why not introduce them to each other online? Kalido gives you the ability to refer and be referred because everybody knows someone.\n\n● Chat: Call, text, or meet up with your matches and trusted contacts directly. Use pre-defined icebreakers to help you get things off the ground and network.\n\n● Trusted matches: we match you with the right people, enabling freelancers to meet new clients, start networking, outsource and succeed in their career.

"description":"This app beautifully displays quotes from all over the world to help you get motivation to work.You can choose to use the app simply as it is, or customize to your liking using more than ten features (most number of features for a quotes app). \nWe have been receiving great reviews, with an average of 4.7 stars.\n\n[List of functions]\n\n- Quote display\n- Favorites\n- Autoplay\n- Background and text design customization\n- Play only favorites\n- VoiceOver\n- Regular notification with your favorite quote\n- BGM\n- Snow animation\n- ... and many more (details below in [Function Details]!)\n\n[Function Details]\n\n- Quote display\n\nWe will deliver only the best quotes, carefully picked from around the world. Every time you press the switch in the Quotes page, a new inspirational quote appears.\nQuotes will be added regularly, and you don't have to update the app to get them. You could also switch between different languages at any point from the Settings page (left swipe from the Quotes page).\n\n- Favorites\n\nYou can \"favorite\" a quote by tapping the star icon in the Quotes page. \nYou can see your favorites list from the Settings page. You could also display only the favorites during Autoplay (when using Autoplay feature), or set a quote from your favorites list as a notification message.\n\n- Autoplay\n\nYou could let the app do the switching by tapping the triangle button on the Quotes page. If you feel tired of pressing the switch every time, please try this function. While the triangle icon is rotating, it is in Autoplay mode. You could end Autoplay mode by tapping anywhere on the screen. You could also change the time interval for Autoplay from the Settings page. Autoplay can be used at the same time as VoiceOver.\n\n- Background and text design customization\n\nSwipe to the right to go to the Design Settings page. You could change background image and text design to your liking. Go ahead and look for your favorite combination of background, text color, and text shadow color. \nTip: It tends to look good if you choose the same color for both text color and text shadow color.\nText size can be changed from the Settings page.\n\n- VoiceOver\n\nUnlike any other quotes app, we have VoiceOver function (reading the quotes out loud). This feature is compatible in Japanese and English.\nPlease do understand that it may sound mechanical at times. You could change the overall tone of the voice from the Settings page.\n\n- Regular notification\n\nGo to Settings -> xxx time -> \"choose message\" to register a message from your favorites list as a notification message. Use this to remind and motivate yourself each day.\n\n- BGM\n\nHow about reading inspirational quotes while listening to calm, natural background music? You can choose from three types of sounds from the nature from the Settings page. You could use this to relax before going to bed.\n\n- Snow animation\n\nAs a small gift to users, we prepared a snow animation. Go to the Settings page and turn the feature on, go back to the Quotes page, and let the sakura fall gently down your screen. True, it might block your view a little. But I think it is sometimes nice to feel the nature while reading inspirational quotes. \n\n- Share with friends\n\nTap the arrow icon on the Quotes page, to show a selection of media to share. Currently we have twitter, facebook and LINE. \nYou could also save the image to your camera roll. Turn on your friend's \"switch\" by sharing your favorite quote. \n\n- Finally\n\nThere are more features than what we have explained above, and we are certain that this app will satisfy any quote lover.\nWe are also doing regular updates to accommodate to the latest OS and features. Please try this app out and see how you like it.", "bundleId":"com.chocofactory.BusinesSwitch", "trackId":794476237, "genreIds":["6000", "6007"], "formattedPrice":"Free", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "sellerName":"YUKI TOYOSHIMA", "minimumOsVersion":"8.4"},

One app, one screen lets you view and post all user-content regardless of what social media platform is it on. You gain “intelligent control” over searching, sorting and curating all of your feeds - control to know something before others do, to know more than others do - control to be more well-informed all from what is already flowing through your social mobile apps. SparksFly™ brings people, brands, ideas and relevant real-time information closer together than ever before. \n\nSparksFly™ Patent-pending Artificial Intelligence \nWe took another GIANT leap forward in the evolution of social media by applying our multi-patent-pending AI Engine to all the content across your selected social networks within the SparksFly™ app. Our engine “discovers and surfaces” uniquely relevant pieces of content, facts, trends, places, people, topics and ideas, “Sparks”, that would have been impossible to discover on your own culling through thousands of posts across multiple social networks in real time. The more our AI engine learns about what you do, like and dislike in your feeds, the brighter and more frequent the “Sparks” fly. Sparks come from from the collection of content flowing through ALL of your feeds together NOT Twitter, or Facebook, or Instagram, etc. separately. \n\nSparksFly’s™ single screen and individualized AI engine enable anyone who uses more than one social network to keep up with ALL content and get ahead of its collective meaning. It's a MUST HAVE for those who use social to be in-the-know or want to be one of the first-to-know without the massive time commitment required today. \n\nSocial simplified. It's about time.\n\nGet the App Now!", "bundleId":"com.sparksfly.iphone", "trackId":731499969, "genreIds":["6005", "6012"], "formattedPrice":"Free", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "sellerName":"Sparks Fly Technologies, Inc", "minimumOsVersion":"9.0"},

Or even just the person you met while you were out at dinner last night with that amazing job opportunity? Chances are, you have a pile of business cards that you’re afraid to throw away because there’s definitely a possibility that you might reach out to one of them for something. But what do you do with them in the meantime?\n\nNot to mention those times when you met that perfect business contact but you just realized you forgot to restock your own cards in your wallet! That cocktail napkin with your phone number will definitely hold up in their pocket.

Masz w firmie kolegę... wiesz jak się nazywa i czym się zajmuje w pracy ale nie wiesz, że po godzinach ten miły młody człowiek ubabrany smarem z pasją naprawia stare motocykle.\n\nPrzykład 2. Znasz swojego lekarza pediatrę, bo on leczy Twoje dzieci ale nie masz pojęcia, że to pasjonat rowerowy, który po godzinach - dzień w dzień - robi blisko 50 kilometrów na rowerze jeżdżąc po lesie a w dodatku praktykuje jogę. Tak jak Ty.\n\nPrzykład 3. Masz w pracy informatyka? Na pewno. A tu nagle okazuje się, że ten chłopak w weekendy genialnie tańczy salsę a w lato wymiata na wake’u. Fascynujące, prawda? Ale Ty o tym dotąd nie wiedziałeś.\n\nDowiesz się tego dzięki IcanDO.

"description":"STOP meeting people the WRONG way. Mutual acquaintances & friends-of-friends are the best way to create valuable relationships. Period.\nThink about your relationships (business or personal). How many people do you know that:\n- don’t know anyone else you know (e.g. your friend doesn’t know any of your other friends)\nAND\n- you don’t know anyone else that knows them (e.g. no one else you know has met this friend)\n?\nProbably not very many. Chances are, you’ve met many of your friends or colleagues through previous acquaintances, or you’ve introduced them to other people you know.\n\nIntros leverages this basic tenant of human relationships. Stop looking for cold strangers to meet. You are already linked to thousands of people, through the friends of your friends that have not been introduced to you yet:\n* make a new business connection. Your friends can introduce you to someone who is in your industry\n* make a new friend. Who else but your friends would know best about who you are compatible with?\n* reestablish old connections. Suggest a meetup with old acquaintances you haven’t talked to in a while\n\nAPP FEATURES:\n* Easily introduce people from your contact book to each other using SMS or email. Intro’d parties are put in a chat room together.\n* Privacy protected – when you Intro people to each other, their private data is not revealed automatically.

Intros Card makes this easy!\n* Track your progress – your activity in the app is used to calculate a “Net Intros Score”. See how your relationships and social clout improve over time as you make more Intros!\n* Your own personal AI assistant – EZRA helps you in many ways.
