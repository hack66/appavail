"description":"Serato Pyro automatically plays and mixes your music and never skips a beat.\n\n“Serato Pyro helps set fire to your aux cord” - Hypebeast.com\n\nPyro is the perfect music player for parties, road trips and working out.\n\nTo get started, simply create a playlist from music in your device's Spotify, iTunes or iCloud Music library. Pyro will automatically mix between songs, bringing you a continuous flow of music.\nWhen your playlist runs out of music, Pyro will automatically select and play the next song based on your recent plays.

"description":"\"Hook is exactly what the doctor ordered. Many apps came close but you nailed it.\" —DJ puzzle\n\n\"Hook is definitely the most fun I've had making music on iOS.  The sampling options are vast and the editing is intuitive.  It's connectivity and versatility makes it a powerful performance tool and production sketchbook.\" — Starkey\n\n5 STARS \"Most impressive DJ mashup & sampler / editor I've seen on iOS so far! It's like the best of all other apps combined in one and all of the latest developments integrated like recording or importing ur own music and inter-app audio.\" — App Store Review\n\n====\nThis is the free iPhone version of Hook. There's also an iPad version for 13 bucks. The feature sets are identical, but the iPad version is optimized for the larger screen, including iPad Pro. The iPad version also comes with 4 additional sound packs with over 500 samples.\n====\n\nHook is a new music performance, mashup, and DJ app for iPhone and iPad. Arrange and trigger loops on a grid and create dynamic, expressive transitions with the Flux Fader — a multitouch \"smart crossfader\" that allows you to expressively make transitions between any combination of tracks/cells on the fly. The Flux Fader includes a two-axis control with 9 riser synths, glitch and gate effects, tempo-synced filter sweeps, an EQ, beat drop, tape stop, and filter drop. Combining all these to make transitions is the heart of playing live with Hook. Hook includes a full editor complete with auto transient slicing and waveform editing. Tight integration with AudioCopy makes it easy to drop in your own loops and sounds from other apps.\n\nReal creative power can be found in the integrated sampler — record from mic/line, other apps via inter-app audio, and grab hooks from iTunes and Spotify. Change tempo in real time, and keep all your hooks in sync. Hook is a killer mashup tool with a full mixer, tons of tracks, integrated FX bus, per-cell fx, transpose, time stretching, tuning, timing and trigger settings, and more. Imagine the clip launching capabilities of Ableton Live in a futuristic multitouch environment.\n\n====\nExtend Hook with Wej!\nWej is an iOS music hub that combines a non-skid performance base with integrated lightshow and wireless MIDI for up to two controllers — all while keeping your iOS device charged.

We've build a \"bot\" that do the hard work for you. So this is the idea:\n\n* You create a new playlist or use an existing one.\n* Then, you synchronize to this playlists other playlists you love or follow.\n* Once you have some playlists you thing that are great, the bot will copy them to your own playlist every 15 minutes. In other words, each time that a playlist you love adds a song, it will be automatically added to your playlist.\n\nWhy this will help me? Because you will be able to delete the songs you don't like and the \"bot\" will add every song you may love because of the other playlists.\n\nThis will save you a lot of time to create your best playlist ever and share it in the social media!\n\n\n*** Please note: This app is not affiliated with Spotify but It’s required to have an account of Spotify to use the app.", "bundleId":"com.danigil.megaplaylists", "trackId":1241756692, "genreIds":["6011", "6007"], "releaseDate":"2018-02-22T00:23:14Z", "primaryGenreName":"Music", "primaryGenreId":6011},

"description":"JOIN THE PLAYLIST !\nDecide the music together\n\nWaveUp is the coolest collaborative playlist application. It allows you to decide what music is played at parties, instantly and from your phone.\n\n● How does it work?\nAll you have to do is create a room by giving it a name and an emoji code. You can then invite your friends to join it so that together you can add your music.\nThe coolest thing: Everyone can enjoy their favorite music and bring it up to the top of the playlist! The most liked song will be played first!\n\n● Where does the music come from?\nThe person who creates a room must sign in to a premium Spotify account to enable music addition. Don't have one? Let a Spotify subscriber create the room. You can then join it, add music and like or dislike the songs in the room. WaveUp will soon be available with Deezer and Apple Music.\n\nFollow us !\nFacebook: WaveUp\nInstagram: waveupapp\nTwitter: @waveupapp", "bundleId":"com.nolane.waveup-app", "trackId":1448007624, "genreIds":["6011"], "releaseDate":"2019-03-14T13:38:33Z", "primaryGenreName":"Music", "primaryGenreId":6011},

The Apple Remote would cost a significant amount. Add ANOTHER hit to your wallet for a wireless control like a keyboard, mouse, or the Apple Magic Trackpad!\n\nYou carry your iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad wherever you go… so why should you carry a second device just to control your computer? Furthermore, why should you need line-of-sight to do so?\n\nEnter Rowmote Pro! Rowmote Pro is like your Mac’s remote control, but over the wireless network and even better! Trackpad and keyboard give you complete control over your computer, and you can control, launch, and quit apps, toggle the iTunes Visualizer, and more without ever having to squint at your screen.

"description":"Have you ever wondered how a particular song got to the #1 spot on the Top 40 Music Charts?  Us too!  SmashChart is a user generated Top 40 Music Chart, but with a twist, we present the user with the previous weeks Top 40.  Rather than vote for the songs you like, you \"Smash\" the songs you don't like.  At the end of the day, the least smashed song is a true representation of the most popular music.  \n\nWhen you first log-in to SmashChart, you will be immediately taken to the smash screen.  From here you can:\n\n*Preview the song\n*Buy the song if you like it\n*Or Smash the song if you don't\n\nSo you see this is a true music discovery app as well, we aren't going to recommend songs like iheart radio or Pandora, but if you see a song rising to the top of the SmashChart Top 40, how could millions of people be wrong.   \n\nFrom the Smash Screen, head on over one tab to the SmashChart Top 40.  This is where all of your hard work is reflected.  You can watch in real time as songs move up and down the SmashChart Top 40, pretty cool huh.  At the end of the day and week our data is saved to create the one and only SmashChart Top 40.\n\nDid we mention that you can follow other smashers?  Invite people into the only music related social network.  We have added one of the coolest features to stay connected with other SmashChart users. \n\n*Post pictures from concerts (or anything for that matter)\n*Tag friends\n*Comment on other pictures\n\nDon't get us wrong, we love seeing all of your cool pics and comments, but what we love seeing more is our friends expressing their musicality.

Unique sequences are played according to your listening behaviour and also the listening behaviour of other (anonymous) users with similar musical taste, local time, weather, sound volume, among other things.\n\nJust like a cool pair of jeans that you bought long time ago, but never wore before, Re/ brings up all the good stuff that you have stored deep down in your music library. Just launch it and listen. Let the app do the work and surprise you.\n\nRe/ is made by music lovers to music lovers!\n\nIMPORTANT: In order to work, this app needs at least 10 songs in your music library. The more songs you have, the better your listening experience will be.", "bundleId":"com.reapp", "trackId":1233568767, "genreIds":["6011"], "releaseNotes":"Improved personal music analytics", "releaseDate":"2017-05-17T02:22:02Z", "primaryGenreName":"Music", "primaryGenreId":6011},
