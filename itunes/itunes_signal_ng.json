"description":"OpenSignal is the ultimate signal toolkit that shows you how to get a better network connection instantly, find nearby free Wifi hotspots worldwide, view signal maps so that you can compare performance of networks in your area and test the speed of your mobile or Wifi connection. \n\nUnlike other apps, which look for maximum possible speed through optimized testing, OpenSignal informs you about your true speed - what you are likely to experience when normally using your phone. Anyone using the app contributes data, informing others about real-world, not estimated, mobile performance (and we'll never ask you for personal information, just your signal strength stats).\n\nWith OpenSignal you can map cellular coverage, find Wi-Fi hotspots, test and improve your reception & get faster data.\n\n- Signal compass points you in the direction your signal is coming from \n- Speed test for download, upload and latency\n- Map of cell towers and Wifi hotspots\n- Coverage maps allow you see the best/worst places for 2G, 3G and 4G \n- Free and ad-free\n\nBased on our community-generated data we are able to help keep you better connected by giving you a practical solution to the problems of slow mobile internet. Simply follow our signal compass to walk towards better phone signal or see our in-app copoverage maps to work out which carrier is best for where you are, useful if you're thinking about switching networks. Our wifi maps help you find local public-access wireless networks (Wifi hotspots).\n\nMaps are not updated in real-time. Don’t worry though, we log the information you share with us to improve our coverage maps and performance information. We’re working hard to make sure the data you contribute to the project is available to everyone as quickly as possible. \n\nTips:\n- Not all towers and wireless hotspots are in our database - we’re working on it!\n- Moving in the direction of your cell tower (the signal compass) will not always improve reception due to interference effects/local geography\n- Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nIf you read to here (!) you should really join the OpenSignal beta to help us improve the app, just email hi@opensignal.com if you're interested.", "bundleId":"com.opensignal.OpenSignalMaps", "releaseNotes":"We've added a dialog for all users (new and existing), to make it clearer how we use your data and ask for your consent for this.", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true},

"description":"ABOUT THIS COURSE\n\nThis course introduces signal processing tools currently used in geophysics. It has been elaborated both from the book \"Signal processing for geologists and geophysicists\" (J.L. Mari, F. Glangeaud, F. Coppens, 1999) and from the CD \"Signal processing in geosciences\" (F. Glangeaud ,J.L. Mari, 2000).\n\nFor signal processing specialists, it will be a source of how classical or new theories can be applied to field data.Teaching staff should find it provides a means of tackling the teaching signal processing techniques.\n\n- - -\n\nFOREWORD\n\nThis on line course presents a succession of lessons classed by theme. The different themes that are tackled are:\n\n• The Fourier Transformation\n• Common functions in spectral analysis\n• Sampling\n• Correlation\n• Wave separation\n• Seismic applications\n• The Hilbert transformation\n• Filtering\n• Near Surface Geophysics\n• Stochastic Signal Processing\n• Attributes\n\nEach theme has an introduction and a series of lessons which are associated with it. A lesson comprises of text, a video, a formulary, if judged necessary, and in some cases an applet to practice.\n\n• The text present has been voluntarily reduced; its objective is put across by the animation. This objective may be the presentation of a specific transform used in signal processing and applied in seismic processing. The term \"transform\" is used here in a very general sense. It covers at times the notion of transformation, such as the Fourier transformation or filters such as the Wiener filter. The objective perhaps being to show the application of a \"transform\" on simulated synthetic data or on real acquired geophysical data.\n\n• The video is an illustration of the text. It permits a visualization of the data, to study the influence of processing parameters on the data. The images were conceived in a manner which permits an immediate visual comparison and that enables an evaluation of the influence of a parameter change on the data processing. If an applet is associated with the video, some parameters can be modified by moving the cursors, the calculations taking place in real time.\n\n• The formulary gives the mathematical formula used in the animation. The reader is invited to use the book cited above as a reference for the notations used and the demonstrations. The formulary should be considered as a simple memory aid.\n\nThe videos and the applets have been created thanks to the MUSTIG software ( mustig.free.fr, Gérard Lejeune).\nIn this on line course, 20 lessons can be selected. For the animations based on field data measurement, the authors or organisms that provide with them are mentioned.\n\nThis on line course does not constitute a complete course in itself ; referral to the basic signal processing texts remains essential.\n\n- - -\n\nTHE AUTHOR\n\nJean-Luc Mari is at present a geophysics professor at IFP School and an IFPEN expert. He supervises the MSc research program in \"Lithosphere, Basins, Petroleum\" part of the Master's program in Science and Technology (Paris VI).\n\nJean-Luc Mari is a member of the European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers.\n\nJean-Luc Mari is author and co-author of patents (in the field of acoustic well logging), numerous scientific articles and books on geophysical methods and signal processing.\n\nHe has been involved in the design and development of specific teaching aids (on-line (http://www-ig.unil.ch/cours/) and CD-ROMs).\n\nHis main fields of expertise are seismic acquisition and processing, geophysics of reservoirs and civil engineering.", "bundleId":"com.odysys.signalprocessing", 
"releaseNotes":"A new subject entitled “Attributes” has been added. \nIn the “ Near surface geophysics”  subject, the lesson “ Flow” has been added.\nIn the “Stochastic Signal Processing” subject, the lesson  “Depth conversion” has been added.\nThe subjects “Seismic applications” and “ Dispersive waves” have been merged in a single subject” Seismic applications”\nThe “ Attribute”  subject is composed of 6 lessons. In the session, we give the fundamentals on the main seismic attributes. We show how signal processing tools are used to create the attributes. Through examples, we illustrate the applications of seismic attributes to seismic processing and interpretation:\n• Envelope\n• RMS-Amplitude\n• Instantaneous Phase\n• Instantaneous Frequency\n• Dip & Azimuth\n• Coherency\n\nNow, the different subjects that are tackled are: \n• The Fourier Transformation\n• Common functions in spectral analysis\n• Sampling\n• Correlation\n• Wave separation\n• Seismic applications\n• The Hilbert transformation\n• Filtering\n• Near Surface Geophysics\n• Stochastic Signal Processing\n• Attributes", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true},

"description":"ChatSecure is a free and open source messaging app that features OTR encryption over XMPP. You can connect to an existing Google account, create new accounts on public XMPP servers (including via Tor), or even connect to your own server for extra security.\n\nUnlike other apps that keep you stuck in their walled garden, ChatSecure is fully interoperable with other clients that support OTR and XMPP, such as Adium, Jitsi, and more.\n\nChatSecure only uses well-known open source cryptographic libraries to keep your conversations private. Other apps may make claims about 'military grade' security but, without publicly auditable source code and verifiable end-to-end encryption, you cannot be truly safe.\n\n* XMPP with TLS certificate pinning.\n* OTR for verifiable end-to-end encryption and forward secrecy.\n* OMEMO for a mobile-friendly alternative to OTR.\n* Tor integration for easy access to XMPP .onion services.\n* SQLCipher to locally encrypt conversation logs.\n* Free and Open Source: https://github.com/chatsecure/chatsecure-ios\n\nFollow @ChatSecure on Twitter: https://twitter.com/chatsecure\n\n►► ChatSecure Donations\nSubscribe to ChatSecure to help make developing free and open source privacy tools sustainable.

"description":"Our CoverageMap app empowers you to test network performance in areas where you live, work, and play. Not only does testing performance in your neighborhood provide you with useful insights, but the data you produce also helps carriers improve the quality of your mobile life.\n\nThe newest version of the app for iOS has expanded the functionality and ease of use found in previous versions to give you a personal network testing and comparison tool that’s better than ever. And whether you’re already familiar with our CoverageMap app or simply curious about testing mobile network performance in your neighborhood, you’ll quickly see how easy it is to get started.\n\nNew features:\n•\tImproved user interface. Our updated app not only boasts a beautiful new user interface, but it also makes it easy to find and select the options and settings you want to use before running a test. Plus, easily identify areas that have yet to be tested, and be the first to put yourself on the map. \n•\tA world of results on an expanded dashboard. Your test results can tell you a great deal about your daily mobile life. Get a broader understanding of your findings with new stats such as moving averages, histories, and more. \n•\tPersonalize your results. Wondering how performance with your carrier of choice compares between the office and at home? Now you can find out. Easily select multiple hexes on the map to compare your results, and find out if others are having the same experience. \n•\tTest how you want, when you want. Set your device to automatically run performance tests continuously, or sample network conditions in the background. Stop a test at any time with either setting.

While we love to see more and more data points appear on the map, you can also tell us about your experience in your own words. Whether it’s something you feel requires our attention, or you just want to say you’ve had a great experience testing performance, we want to hear from you.\n\nEnjoying the app?

No need to switch tabs and the landing happens always on the recent, if you don't find the contact there, just pull down to search.\n* Smart search, that learns who you call the most and gives you the first result as a top hit, while reducing the number of letters you type before finding your contact.\n* Adding a contact is super fast. we don't stop you to ask if you are adding to existing or updating a new one, it happens along the way and reduces 3 steps out of the overall scenario.\n* While adding a contact, no need to move your finger and look at the upper screen to switch fields, you can swipe the keyboard to jump lines while keeping your fingers on the keyboard to save you time.\n* Forgot their names?

"description":"Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) which is developed by Gerald Appel in the late seventies, is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of prices. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-day exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-day EMA. A nine-day EMA of the MACD is called the \"signal line\".\n\nThe two most popular strategies to generate buy/sell signals from MACD are as follow:\n\nCenter Line Crossover\n==============\n1. Potential BUY signal is generated when the 12-day EMA moves above the 26-day EMA.\n2. Potential SELL signal is generated when the 12-day EMA moves below the 26-day EMA.\n\nSignal Line Crossover\n===============\n1. Potential BUY signal is generated when the MACD turns up and crosses above the signal line.\n2. Potential SELL signal is generated when the MACD turns down and crosses below the signal line.\n\nEasy MACD Crossover provides a comprehensive dashboard that allows you to view the BUY/SELL signals from two of the most popular and effective strategies on many popular instruments and across multiple timeframes (M5, M15, M30, H1, H4, D1) at one glance. (Please note that M5 is only available for viewing as an optional in-app subscription) In this way, you do not miss out any trading opportunities even on the go.\n\nBelow are some of the key features of the app.\n\n- Timely display of BUY/SELL signals from two of the most popular and effective strategies on many popular instruments across multiple timeframes,\n- Timely push notification alert when BUY/SELL signals are generated based on your favourite instruments on your watch list,\n- Display headline news of your favourite instruments\n\nEasy Indicators relies on your support to fund its development and server costs.

"description":"This Currency Strength Meter is a Forex trading tool that displays currency strength for several currencies on multiple time-frames.\n\nWhat is Currency Strength?\n\nCurrency strength is a unique way to assess price action in the Forex market. Instead of watching individual Forex pairs, currency strength measures the strength of an underlying currency.\n\nThis gives important insights into the forces at play causing a move in a particular Forex pair.\n\nFor example, if GBP/USD is breaking out to the upside, currency strength can be used to determine if the move is due to GBP strength or generalized USD weakness. If it's due to USD weakness, there might be trading opportunities on other USD pairs.\n\nCurrency strength is calculated using our own propriety algorithm. We first introduced this is 2011 with our first generation currency strength meter. The algorithm has been refined over time to enhance it's accuracy and responsiveness to changes in market conditions and has proven popular with traders.\n\nThis App uses the same proven algorithm but with even faster refresh rates and lower latency.\n\nCurrency strength is displayed in either bar or chart form and is measured for 8 currencies :  USD (US Dollar), EUR (Euro), GBP (British Pound), JPY (Japanese Yen), CAD (Canadian Dollar), AUD (Australian Dollar), NZD (New Zealand Dollar) and CHF (Swiss Franc).\n\nThe standard App supports 4 time-frames (4-Hourly, Daily, Weekly and Monthly). \n\nAn optional Data Booster Pack adds 15-minute and 1-hourly time-frames. This is available as an In-App purchase subscription, and can be accessed on all of your IOS devices.\n\nFeatures:\n- low latency real-time data, with fast refresh rates\n- up to 6 time-frames\n- bar chart display with historical look-back feature and landscape mode support\n- customizable charts - hide/show currencies, customizable grid lines\n- 50%, 100% chart zoom\n- customizable time zone\n- several color themes\n- optimized for iPhone 6/6+ screen size\n- built in user guide\n- proven, popular currency strength algorithm", "bundleId":"com.qm4investing.fxmeter", "releaseNotes":"Update for iPhone X display compatibility", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true},

The smell of sea water and being captain of your own vessel is pretty heady. Taking in the view, you notice a Naval ship flying unusual flags in the area you’re heading for. There’s an “A” flag, followed by a number 3 flag. You know that seafaring vessels have special signals but you don’t know what they mean. Whipping out your Signal Flags app, you quickly scroll, tapping the appropriate flags to discover that you must avoid the ship within 300 yards as they have divers in the water. You adjust your course a little to comply. Thank goodness you were able to find out before you intruded on the ship’s operation.\n\nSignal Flags have been used for communication between ships at sea since ancient times. They have evolved throughout history and now are uniformly mandated by the International Code of Signals. The flags remove the language barrier by indicating with symbols, many types of distress and information to all U.S. and Allied Forces around the globe. They are used by government, military and civilians traveling the world’s waterways.\n\nThe app contains all of the images, flags and pennants that you’ll need to know, along with detailed descriptions of their usage and meanings in international, military, and sail racing contexts. You don’t need a cumbersome book; you don’t even need an internet connection. Just pull out your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch and open Signal Flags. All the important information is contained right there in the application. Within a few seconds, you’ll know what that ship is telling you.\n\nIn addition to the signal details, this app supplies you with the complete documentation of the NIMA pub. 102 and the U.S. Department of Transportation/U.S. Coast Guard Navigation Rules (COMDTINST M16672.2D).  Both documents include extensive in-document hyperlinks for accessibility along with a specialized toolbar for quick and simple browsing.  A specialized quiz function is also provided to aid in memorization of the entire flag set. \n\n\u2028Features:\n\n* Designed and developed by a U.S. Naval Academy graduate\n* Needs no network connection once downloaded\n* Contains all current signal flag details\n* Contains complete documentation as laid out by governing sources\n* Includes a quiz function to help you memorize all the flags\n\nIf you spend time on the open water, are the employee of an organization that navigates the seas, a yacht racer, or an interested student, this application is an indispensable tool. Everything is here for you, at your fingertips, anytime, anywhere.

"description":"Crude oil is a naturally-occurring substance found in certain rock formations in the earth and can be considered the most important commodity in the world today. The product and its derivatives can be found in many application of modern life from transportation to plastics.\n\nCurrently, there are two major benchmarks for world oil prices, West Texas Intermediate (WTI for short) and Brent crude oil. Both are light, sweet crude oils although WTI is relatively sweeter and lighter than its European counterpart. As a result of this, WTI often trades at a premium, usually by just a few dollars a barrel. However, due to a Libyan crisis, which has decreased the supply of light, sweet crude in the European region, and a supply glut at the main storage facility of WTI in Oklahoma, the premium/discount situation has changed and now Brent is more expensive than WTI.\n\nThe recent slump in oil prices present a good investment opportunity.\n\nKey features of Easy Oil Tracker:\n\n- Keep a close watch of the latest oil price using an easy to read dashboard so as to know when is a good time to enter or exit the market.\n- News ticker displaying important news related to oil.\n- Keep yourself informed of the latest news related to oil by reading the list of headline news.\n- Receive notification when oil price moves more than 7%.\n- Share current WTI/Brent oil price with family and friends.\n- Quick access to the Economic Calendar from Forex Factory.\n- Technical analysis of the prices.

Build your own indicator without programming, optionally spanning multiple charting periods.\n\n- You will be alerted in real-time when relevant price action occurs.\n\n- Setup just one alert and monitor all pairs, possibly hundreds, of an exchange.\n\nThe basic functionality of Drakdoo is free to use. There are three subscription plans that you can opt in to that enhance the basic functionality:\n\n- The Goldfish plan: next to price breach alerts, you will be able to make use of intelligent indicator alerts such as RSI.

Price: $16.99 monthly, or, $134.99 annually.\n\nPrices may vary depending on your country.

"description":"EVERFX Trading signals app\n\nThe EVERFX Trading signals app is an advanced application with an outstanding winning rate. This popular app will help traders make better trading decisions by providing the best buy/sell signals on forex pairs, commodities, and stock indices. The app provides a complete signals toolkit which incorporates forex signals, commodities signals, stock indexes signals, Fed rate monitor tool, market sentiment and currency heatmap. \n\nWhat’s in the app? \n\nForex signals\n\nForex signals indicate market trends in real time. The app provides signals for more than 50 forex currency pairs for 7 different time frames.\n\nCommodities signals\n\nCommodities signals provide signals for commodities such as Gold, Silver, Crude oil etc.\n\nStock indexes signals\n\nStock indexes signals provide signals for major world indices such US 30, US100, US 500, DAX, FTSE100, EU50 etc.\n\nFed rate monitor tool\n\nInterest rate changes in the US are felt throughout the markets as even a 0.25% increase or decrease in interest rates can trigger volatility. The Fed rate monitor tool gauges expectations from market participants about the probability of a change in interest rates when the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) next meets to discuss monetary policy. The further away from a 50% probability the indicator demonstrates that an interest rate hike is probable, the higher the likelihood that the FOMC will increase interest rates. Below a 50% probability reflects the sentiment that an interest rate hike is unlikely.\n\nMarket sentiment\n\nTraders use this tool to see the correlation between long and short positions held by other traders.\n\nCurrency heatmap\n\nThe forex currency heatmap is a real time visual map of the entire forex market for identifying strength and weakness in individual currencies.\n\nNever miss a trading opportunity by getting instant notifications on your device. Our expert team is available to offer support to help you maximise your earning potential.\n\nDownload the Trading Signals app today and get the tools used by professional traders in one convenient and functional app.", "bundleId":"com.everfx.signals", "releaseNotes":"Performance improvements", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true},

"description":"The Parabolic Stop and Reverse (SAR) is a simple technical indicator created by Welles Wilder. This trend following indicator is based on the idea that a strong trend will continue to increase in strength over time, following a parabolic arc. It uses a combination of price and time components to generate buy and sell signals. \n\nThe parabolic SAR is typically shown on the charts as a series of small 'dots' that are placed either above or below the price. When the price is trending to the upside, the dots are below the price action and when the price is trending to the downside, the dots are above the price action. It trails the price movement until the price move has finished and begins to reverse.\n\nA BUY signal is generated when the Parabolic SAR moves from being above price to below price and likewise a SELL signal is generated when the Parabolic SAR moves from being below price to above price. The Parabolic SAR is designed to be used in trending markets, and can lead to many false signals in sideways or choppy markets. As such, we are using ADX (Average Directional Index) indicator to filter off signals generated during a ranging market.\n\nLike any other indicators, Easy PSAR should not be used as a standalone indicator for making your trade decision but as a reference to spot potential trade opportunity.\n\nEasy PSAR provides a comprehensive dashboard that allows you to view the BUY/SELL signals on many popular instruments and across multiple timeframes (M5, M15, M30, H1, H4, D1) at one glance. (Please note that M5 is only available for viewing as an optional in-app subscription) In this way, you do not miss out any trading opportunities even on the go.\n\nBelow are some of the key features of the app.\n- Timely display of BUY/SELL signals from the parabolic SAR strategy on many popular instruments across multiple timeframes,\n- Timely push notification alert when BUY/SELL signals are generated based on your favourite instruments on your watchlist,\n- Display headline news of your favourite instruments\n\nIf you choose to subscribe to our Basic/Deluxe plan, payment will be charged to your iTunes account, and your account will be charged for renewal 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.

"description":"SPL Meter is a professional-grade sound level meter, also known as a decibel or dB meter, for your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nModeled after a traditional analog SPL meter, we have faithfully reproduced all the characteristics and qualities found in those meters, including the ballistics, ranges, filters, and decay rates.\n\nUnder the hood we have advanced DSP-based algorithms that meet or exceed ANSI / IEC Type 1 standards. And starting with iOS 6, we can disable the mic filters and limiters, to get the real world performance of a hand-held SPL meter.\n\nAnd now, upgrade SPL Meter with iTestMic, our pro-grade test & measurement mic, made specifically for iOS devices. Using iTestMic with SPL Meter, you get a calibrated, accurate SPL Meter, that meets industry standards for Type 2 performance. See our website for more information.\n\nBut don't compare us to a Radio Shack meter, ours is much more accurate! \n\nWe have also included a digital LCD display, as shown in the image, to make this the best SPL meter available for iPhone or iPad. And this is something that the old analog meters never had! \n\nThe screen will flip when you flip the phone over, so that you can point the iPhone mic directly at the sound source. (iPhone X does not support upside down mode)\n\nSPL Meter is a universal app -- buy once, and use on all of your iOS devices.\n\nSPL Meter is built by the same team that created the other great professional audio and acoustics apps on the store, Studio Six Digital.  Built on the engine of our more expensive \"SPL\" app, SPL Meter's filters and decay rates meet or exceed ANSI type 1. This app is not a toy or a game.\n\nSPL Meter is the one audio app that everyone who works in audio must have on their phone! Not only have we made the best one, but we've priced it so you can't afford not to get it.\n\n*** FEATURES:\n\nFILTERS -- A and C weighting filters are provided.\n\nDECAY -- Choose ANSI Fast or Slow.\n\nRANGES -- 40dB to 120dB in 9 ranges.\n\nCALIBRATION -- Comes pre-calibrated for the typical iPhone or iPad built-in and headset mic, but you can adjust the calibration if you have a professional, calibrated meter to compare it to. Accesses our cloud-based iOS device calibration database, which we updates as new devices are released.\n\nINTERNAL / EXTERNAL MIC -- Select Internal to activate the included compensation filter, which is designed to flatten the frequency response of the built-in or headset mic. External will work with our iPhone Measurement Mic, to be released later this summer. See our website for more details.\n\nSPL Meter is bargain-priced to make it easy for anyone to check out one of our professional, accurate apps. Studio Six Digital is dedicated to making the iPhone and Touch a professional audio and acoustics test device.\n\nCheck out our full line of professional-grade audio and acoustics apps: SPL, the professional digital iPhone sound level meter, SPL Graph, for recording SPL over time, RTA, a 1/3 octave real-time analyzer,  FFT, for detailed acoustic analysis, ETC, the energy-time curve function, RT60, for automated octave-band decay time measurement, Speaker Pop, to test speaker polarity, and Generator, the iPhone signal generator.\n\nAlso, if you are looking for more great acoustical and audio test apps, have a look at AudioTools, our premier app for audio professionals.", "bundleId":"com.studiosix.SPLMeter", "releaseNotes":"-Updated for latest iOS and iOS devices\n-Added new device calibrations", "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true},

"description":"The Momentum indicator is a simple yet useful indicator that compares where the current price is in relation to where the price was in the past. If the current price is higher than the price in the past, then the Momentum indicator is positive. In contrast, when the current price is lower than the price in the past, then the Momentum indicator is negative.\n\nEasy Momentum Crossover uses the Momentum indicator to generate potential trade signals. Potential BUY signal is generated when the Momentum indicator crosses above the zero line. This may imply that the price of the instrument has bottomed out and is reversing or by breaking out above recent highs, either way, these events are often interpreted by traders as bullish signals. Potential SELL signal is generated when the Momentum indicator crosses below the zero line. This may imply that the price of the instrument has topped out and is reversing or that the price has broken below recent lows, either way, these events are often interpreted by traders as bearish signals.\n\nLike any other indicators, Easy Momentum Crossover should not be used as a standalone indicator for determining buy / sell signal but as a reference to spot potential trade opportunity.\n\nEasy Momentum Crossover provides a comprehensive dashboard that allows you to view the BUY/SELL signals from the Momentum crossover strategy on many popular instruments and across multiple timeframes (M5, M15, M30, H1, H4, D1) at one glance. (Please note that M5 is only available for viewing as an optional in-app subscription) In this way, you do not miss out any trading opportunities even on the go.\n\nBelow are some of the key features of the app.\n- Timely display of BUY/SELL signals from the Momentum crossover strategy on many popular instruments across multiple timeframes,\n- Timely push notification alert when BUY/SELL signals are generated based on your favourite instruments on your watchlist,\n- Display headline news of your favourite instruments\n\nIf you choose to subscribe to our Basic/Deluxe plan, payment will be charged to your iTunes account, and your account will be charged for renewal 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.
