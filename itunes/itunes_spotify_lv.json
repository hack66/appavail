"description":"Run longer, faster, and stronger with PaceDJ, the only app that modifies music BPMs to match your running pace AND allows you to create interval workouts.  There is no better running music app – Period. Get it now!\n\nRECOMMENDED BY:\n•New York Times\n•Washington Post\n•Health Magazine\n•Runner’s World \n•Men’s Health\n•Women’s Health\n•RealSimple\n•And more!\n\nWHY WE’RE BETTER THAN OTHER APPS\n\n•We're Personalized: PaceDJ lets you use the songs you have saved in your iTunes library.  This means you are in control of your playlists.  Other services provide random playlists created by DJs who don't know your tastes.  \n\n•We're Precise: Some apps claim they can serve songs at BPMs to pace you to a specific minute/mile time.  Unless they know your stride length, they can't do this accurately.   PaceDJ helps you find the right BPM first, and then fine tune to match your mile time goal.  \n\n•We're Free! Try PaceDJ for free to see how you like it!  Then upgrade to Premium for features including intervals training, dislike button, and remove ads.  \n\n•We're Unique: PaceDJ is the ONLY APP that speeds up or slows down BPMs to match your running pace AND allows you to create interval workouts.   \n\n•Like Intervals?  We've got that! Create custom interval workouts or choose from pre-programmed templates.\n\n•Each song you own can pace you at multiple levels – a massive increase in the usefulness of your music library\n\n•PaceDJ.com provides a FREE music discovery service so you can find and purchase songs that match your running pace.\n\n•Echonest song database has over 35million songs and 2.8 million artists.\n\n•Easily correct BPMs by tapping on the drum. \n\nUSER REVIEWS: \n•\"I love this app, I use it to crank up speed work for marathon training without my pace conflicting with my music!\"\n\n•\"PaceDJ allowed me to find tunes that helped me pace myself… and spend my energy focusing on…proper running form. I use PaceDJ on every run.\"\n\n•\"PaceDJ gives me that extra boost of motivation. It gives me the proper speeds I need to stay on pace and even ramp up my speed work.\"\n\nON THE WEB AT WWW.PACEDJ.COM\n\nTECHNICAL INFORMATION\nv2.0 requires iOS9.0 and higher.\n\nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background in PaceDJ can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE:\ncustomerservice@pacedj.com\n\n\nTHIS APP AND ANY INFORMATION GIVEN BY IT ARE NOT INTENDED NOR IMPLIED TO BE A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL ADVICE.

"description":"We believe music is better with friends! JQBX lets you be a DJ, join a party, or just kick back and listen to music with friends or strangers from all over the world in real time. JQBX hooks into your Spotify account and is 100% free to use. Give it a try and start listening. Together. (Requires a Spotify Premium Account)\n\n\nHow It Works\n\n\nRoom: The place where music gets shared\nYou can create a room or join one that already exists. Rooms can be public or private and you get to decide how many DJ's can take turns playing music. You can also pick the genre and invite friends to join. Once you're in a room you can chat, DJ, listen or just kick back and enjoy the vibe.\n\n\nDJ: The tastemakers\nIf you want to share a song, just click 'be a DJ' and you will be added to the list of DJ's in the room. When it's your turn the song at the top of your queue will play for everyone in the room. If someone votes or stars your track, it will show up on your notifications.\n\n\nChat: Share your thoughts\nEach room has a dedicated chat box where you can share your thoughts about music, life, or anything else. You can single out a single person in the room by pressing the '@' button and picking them from the list. You can also embed images and all sorts of other fun stuff to make your voice heard!\n\n\nDiscover New Music\nDigging a song? Just star it and it will be saved to your starred playlist. Digging someone's vibe? You can follow them and get notified whenever they are spinning on JQBX. Loving the tracks in a room? You can export the entire track history to a playlist to relive the magic at your next party.\n\n\nCustomize Your Profile\nYou can upload unique gifs and change your username in real time to suit your mood! You can have four distinct images to reflect how you feel about a certain song that's being played.\n\n\nKeep Your Hits Organized\nAll the music you save, add to your queue, and export gets instantly added to your Spotify profile. All your music stays in the same place and can be retrieved on any Spotify enabled device.", "bundleId":"com.thebestagency.jqbx", "trackId":1189991978, "isVppDeviceBasedLicensingEnabled":true, "sellerName":"Jason Zigelbaum", "releaseNotes":"*** Add audio quality options to user settings\n*** Add loading screen for public profile pages\n*** Add better performance for meter in rooms", "releaseDate":"2017-01-05T19:00:40Z", "primaryGenreName":"Music", "primaryGenreId":6011},
