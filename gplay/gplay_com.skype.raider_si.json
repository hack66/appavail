  comments:
   [ 'Skype has always been a mixed bag, useful but horribly glitchy, and they keep adding features that range from unnecessary to downright annoying. The new notification sound might appeal to some people, but I want the option to change back to the sound I know and (mostly) like. I hope soon I can convince my friend to use a better messenger app so I can stop bothering with this one.',
     'It\'s a great App, we use it all the time. I just want to report a BUG now. In the android version, if we send a message with a poor internet connection and it remains at "sending" status, we won\'t be able to send any message again using phone, even with a good internet connection. With desktop version we can, but with phone isn\'t possible. Even if we had a "sending" message long time ago, we won\'t be able to send the messages again using phone, unless we find and cancle that "sending" message.',
     'I have been using Skype for 15 years, through many changes. While it\'s still my first choice for international calling, removal of features and increased intrusiveness are getting me to look for alternatives. I can no longer customise my voicemail greeting. I now have to choose between accepting many spam phone calls, or publishing my entire address book as a whitelist. I can\'t simply block a number that keeps coming in. and call quality hasn\'t really improved by a lot in the last ten years.',
     'At times Skype is the best thing on the market, other times it\'s complete ASS! One minute it comes in fine the next you have a poor connection and the video is freezing, then catches up and you have no idea what the other person said. When it does not want to work IT DOESNT! If the bugs were fixed it would be great! I use this app for work every day......Keep that in mind makers of Skype! Keli',
     'On the pc it is very reliable. It was also a much better version in the past, you could do so much! So when i got my phone i needed the skype app to keep in contact with my family. It does great video calls and i love all the orginal and new emotiocons. The phone app is terrible. Its slow to load. It is constantly disconnecting and says no one is online. I cant see them and my messages arent going through. i have no idea why, with this new issue and the slow load time its not fun anymore.' ],
