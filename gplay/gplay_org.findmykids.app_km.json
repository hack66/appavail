  comments:
   [ 'GPS tracking on the map works sporadic and inaccurate. Most of time, not working. It takes days to update, no matter what settings I have done. Also the phone book update on app doesn\'t update on the watch even after restart.',
     'I want my money back, you fraud me!!! I bought your app ONLY because I can hear my son and what\'s going on around him. And I don\'t have that! WHY YOU DIDN\'T WRITE DOWN NEXT TO "bay it forever" ,YOU DON\'T PAYING LISTENING!!! And I\'ll never spend my money for something what I have already with app FAMILY LINK!!! YOU FRAUD ME!!!',
     'I like this app because I can hear my child if doesn\'t answer texts to make sure is Ok . Keeps going off saying no signal of contact with child even though could be outside of upstairs so that\'s the only downfall at moment.. Get 3 minutes free of hearing child then pay to continue yet already pay for some so why pay more, should be included ...',
     'I\'m mind blown. Best Support I\'ve ever experienced. At 4am their time my question regarding lost minutes after I had done a factory reset was answered within 3 minutes maximum. Very Kind people to deal with and not only was i reissued the previously purchased minutes but they comped me twice that. Otherwise this app has operated nothing less than flawlessly and has been an asset to resolving the bullying my son is suffering at school. Very Very Highly Recommended by myself as well as my family.',
     'i thought this app is free why there\'s a pop up ask for $30.99 subscription for a year? is this app free?????' ],
