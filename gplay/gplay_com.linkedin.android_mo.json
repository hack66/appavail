  comments:
   [ 'A very natural and respective way of connecting with people from every walks of life,every line of work and in a professional manner..unlike "facebook" which is a total waste of your time. if you mean professionalism and enthusiasm..you have it here on LinkedIn however there is a limit as to how many people can connect..that limit shouldnt be there..',
     'For those with low vision, the update is a total disaster. little print, format of postings is hard to read, pm\'s written to others no longer have blue background contrast. this is key for those of us with low vision. Not happy with this. Doubt Ill be on LI but so much longer. A real shame..messed up a once great program w/ the " update."',
     'makes it easier to get ahold of people who are sometimes very difficult and to voice your support or negative in put, I think that\'s healthy for support. Good idea makes everyone feel better when someone doesn\'t have their hand over your mouth. But keep both feet clean you might forget witch one of them you had in your mouth last. LOL Butch',
     'Logout not poss (Once you in, you all in policy?), cant edit/renew pw without a ph nbr, I\'m deaf, I don\'t text/call. Inconvenient. Minor bug in viewing/browsing jobs + job suggestions by \'because you viewed\' feature. Connecting to self. Receiving connection requests from people all around the world whom I have not met in reality. Thank you for the reply. The link you replied isn\'t clickable, sorry. I updated app version. Connection automatically to people i don\'t know !!!',
     'Too many outdated contacts. App keeps suggesting linking with people who have been dead for several years. Wants me to congratulate people on milestone achievements like work anniversaries, even though said person hasn\'t worked for that company for a while. Not reliable and actually is annoying.' ],
