  comments:
   [ 'Excellent security tool. One persistent problem though has been the inability to send and receive voice calls due to what appears to be a time variation issue according to several chat forms.',
     'i have used this app for many months and i have come to apperciate the attention to detail to even down to the emojis. ðŸ™‚ this internal mental break down of emoji has been used to bring people closer. and the attention to detail in how big the emojis can be based on use is nice. 5/5 good eyes for detail.',
     'Why cant i choose which SIM card i want to send SMS from? I was trying to start a new conversation and the app kept trying to send SMS from SIM 2 which wasn\'t even activated. I had to download another app just because i wanted to send a SMS from SIM 1. phew!',
     'great app but it has limited use because every contact is allowed to send media. need a way to only allow certain contacts to send media. those without media permissions should get a transmission error if they try to send a picture, video, link, document, basically text only 4u & u.',
     'Excellent private messenger and wifi phone app. I\'ve used Signal for years and it\'s first rate. it\'s great as a group discussion spp too. i cannot think why anyone would use a so-called privacy messenger that\'s owned by Facebook, premier corporate mass surveillance company (WhatsApp). Ditch it and get your privacy app from a company you can trust! ,' ],
