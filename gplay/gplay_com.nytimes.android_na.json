  comments:
   [ 'used to love the nyt app and availability on my phone. in the last 2 months though it has gotten slow and weird (freezes constantly, screen flickers, ads are super annoying). I pay for a subscription but plan to cancel because it has gotten really bad.',
     'NYTimes app fails to adapt. I can\'t even provide a review without limitations. I have google news app. the google app is quick and ahead of nytimes. i have to rely on google news to let me know what ny times has reported. ny times doesnt always alert it\'s buyers of new stories. they pick and choose.',
     'Taps on external links and notifications often open the app to an error page. When connectivity is lost, it dumps you out of the article you\'re reading. This app is impossibly bad for the high reputation the New York Times has.',
     'Was  not able to access the subscription after purchase. Neither Google Playstore or NYT were any help in solving this. The playstore denied my refund. I recommend going straight to NYT and not use this subscription offering from Google.',
     'Crashes while loading ads App is nicely designed, but constantly crashes while loading the *many* ads. 3/11/19 - articles load, if i can complete reading them before ad loading triggers a crash, I am lucky.' ],
