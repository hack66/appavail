   [ 'it\'s wow..installing it there is no tension about mobile data..anytime anywhere free free sometimes it doesn\'t work as well but it\'s cool..and guys install it',
     'The best free vpn in the play store. Hands down. A nice selection of countries to choose from, among other great features like selective tunnelling and the fact that it\'s open-source, make this my new go-to vpn. I\'m stuck on this one. It kicks the pants off the other free vpns. Get it, you won\'t regret it! Deserves 6 stars. ALSO, you should look into what F-droid is! Churz',
     'This even works on school Wi-Fi But needs more options so I can be able to contact them or cancel my payment. but overall this is great but need more things so I wont feel like I got scamed and just taking money out of my account. but great for wifi and school so you look up anything you want in the outside world of school.',
     'Hello developer, I just need to know if your app has free internet or it works because the tunnel was connected if I have wifi or data but it can\'t access if I have no wifi or data. My wifi was limited and I didn\'t want to cost the MB so I just want to have unlimited wifi. Please comment me if it is works for umlimited wifi and I will give you 5 stars 😁',
     'from feb 2019 onwards its having issues cany connect... even if it does it disconnects within few minutes.' ],
