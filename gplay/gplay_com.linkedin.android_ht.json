  comments:
   [ 'Helped me troubleshooting a problem within 24 hours of my complaint. Keep up to great work your platform is very good. Although my one issue is that your job recommendations are normally 4 years above my skill level. So a better method for identifying entry level jobs would be much appreciated.',
     'The content and intent of the app is really good. But the performance of the app is really bad. It always says "we are unable to load feed, try again later" after n number of retries also it is not loading. Tried uninstalling and installing many times.This needs to be really fixed.',
     'Too many outdated contacts. App keeps suggesting linking with people who have been dead for several years. Wants me to congratulate people on milestone achievements like work anniversaries, even though said person hasn\'t worked for that company for a while. Not reliable and actually is annoying.',
     'Excellent app with focussed purpose. Much needed professional networking. Minor concern: Don\'t understand why the layout is changing so often (literally everyday) with the messaging icon being toggled between bottom centre and top right.',
     'Session keep expired, cannot save message that I want to send to recruiters (Career interests - note to recruiter). Cannot upload resume. PLEASE DONT IGNORE USER REQUESTS. Im so frustrated about your attitude. Always selectively reply to users message and ignore the problems.' ],
