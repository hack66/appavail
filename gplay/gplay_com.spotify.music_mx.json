   [ 'Can\'t describe properly but seriously it\'s worthless. The interface is awful and the advertisements in free version are just annoying. First time I am giving a 2 star rating to any app and that\'s one and only spotify.',
     'Where is the update log. If we don\'t know what you change we can\'t be sure of it\'s your app screwing up or a different one. Ex, was your update what caused the app to stop responding to lock screen song changes? Or did it cause the playlist function to double play every song? We don\'t know because you won\'t tell us what you are doing...',
     'stop changing the lay-out please. yesterday I was enjoying my music. and I checked Spotify later that same day. y\'all changed the whole lay-out. I dont like that. you better make an option to change the lay-out in the setting. or just make it the other lay-out. because this is straight up ugly',
     'Love the service, but this app SUCKS. No UI update at all, everytime I open the app it gets stuck loading so I have to go back and forth to load it properly. I\'d like to see what are you updating in a changelog instead of the lazy message "we\'re always making changes blablabla". It\'s embarrassing to see such a huge app using stuff like this. You keep recommending me music that I wouldn\'t ever listen. And as I pay for the service, I\'d like to see improvements every once in a while...',
