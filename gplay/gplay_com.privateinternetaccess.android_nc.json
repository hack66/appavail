   'Browse privately on the internet. Stay anonymous and secure on public WiFi. Hide your IP address and encrypt your traffic to connect to blocked apps and websites with our unlimited bandwidth VPN.

  comments:
   [ 'Not impressed. Buggy AF on Android. While it did fix Verizon\'s throttling of YouTube, twitch, Netflix, etc, I will randomly lose ALL connectivity and have to force close the VPN. Update: contacted customer support and was told it\'s normal and they couldn\'t do anything about it. It\'s nice to SOMETIMES be able to get around Verizon\'s throttling, it\'s not worth the headache to pause, unpause, force close, and restart this app fifty times a day.',
     'Doesn\'t work anymore, since the last update this app is useless.i paid for 2 years upfront and now I see that was a bad decision. Every server I tried to connect to fails, this is not good! Update: as of 3/15/19 go into your phones Android VPN settings and select the VPN as Always-on active, since doing that i am now able to connect to vpn servers again and you can toggle it on or off through the PIA shortcut!',
     'PIA is great unfortunately this version has been causing some bugs (Android 9.0, Note 9). This are the the PIA notification toggle saying connection is still ongoing when it\'s not, staying in the pull down menu even after turning it off, having duplicate toggles in this pull down menu both have different running counts for ongoing connection when there is none and the inability to remove said notifications from the menu without turning notifications off completely... Thank you, will do.',
     'This app has been great, but now I\'m experiencing crazy battery drain to the point where I can watch my battery percentage tick down. Will update when this issue is fixed.',
     'Doesn\'t work on my windows computer even with several attempts with tech support, restricting my use to Android cell phone only. I\'ve used this product for years and now most US servers have pings in the thousand ms making them unusable (for weeks) as well. My fastest server is in another country which doesn\'t work for me. Read reviews carefully and look into other products before choosing this one as I think you will be disappointed.' ],
