   [ 'Brilliant! Works flawlessly, and exactly as described. Functional, without frills. Its simplicity is highly refreshing - an app which performs its intended function with the accuracy and efficency on a par with the finest of Swiss watches, but without the bling found on modern impostors. Highly commended for sticking to your brief. Richly deserved five gold stars from a very happy and contented user. üçª',
     'Update: change from 1 to 4 stars. Waited 24 hours and tried to log in again. Now password is recognized. i was using copy paste so the password was the same. seems there is a delay between account setup and finalization of account. recovery email works now also. After initial logout, wait 24 hours before login to see if this resolves your password issue. I still believe the biggest problem is communication skills between the developers and end users.',
     'Uggh!! this is so frustrating! The app is slow, crashes a lot, and now I can\'t send emails because "there\'s no network connection" even though I can submit this review online just fine! Pls fix! This is the email we use for work!',
     'Does not sync with the web version. it never has, and this is a known issue since 2018 and it still is not fixed. support for this issue is horrible. It simply does not work. I can\'t even tell you how many times I\'ve uninstalled and reinstalled this app',
     'The general UI is beautifully designed. But the app is sorely lacking :               [ conversation view ] & [ preview attachments ].  In 2019 these features are pretty basic, though. Also, mobile notifications arrive very late compared to the webmail. So I can\'t use it for work.' ],
