   [ 'Update: change from 1 to 4 stars. Waited 24 hours and tried to log in again. Now password is recognized. i was using copy paste so the password was the same. seems there is a delay between account setup and finalization of account. recovery email works now also. After initial logout, wait 24 hours before login to see if this resolves your password issue. I still believe the biggest problem is communication skills between the developers and end users.',
     'It\'s good. Nothing exceptional, but it works. One thing annoying me and the reason why I gave it 4* is the fact that if I archive / delete an email from the web interface, I still see the push notification on my phone. Or even worse, I delete it and afterwards I still receive the push notification (because it\'s a bit delayed). This is sometimes confusing.. If this gets fixed, I\'ll change my review to 5*. Apart from that, the design is a bit "meh", not so modern anymore, compared to the new Gmail design. I\'m also missing the snoozing functionality of Gmail.  Other than that it\'s good, it works and I still recommend it. (I have the paid plan and I\'m using a custom domain)',
     'App tracks your location, without permission. If that doesn\'t tell you everything about this app and its developers, then you deserve all the digital consequences. Crashy, buggy, and silly, this app should really just not exist. Use the web version and save yourself the troubles this app brings.',
     'The general UI is beautifully designed. But the app is sorely lacking :               [ conversation view ] & [ preview attachments ].  In 2019 these features are pretty basic, though. Also, mobile notifications arrive very late compared to the webmail. So I can\'t use it for work.',
     'I just started using Proton mail and LOVE it. The free version is great but I wanted to have an address for my Linux project linked to my main one as well, so I upgraded to the $15 or so plan that includes ProtonVPN (loving that too by the way).' ],
