   'The all-in-one VPN tunneling, firewall & proxy bypassing, anonymization and anti-censorship solution\r\n\r\nIs your Internet access being censored? Are some things on the Internet simply not accessible to you? Do you need protection from eavesdroppers or access without a login on an unencrypted wireless hotspot network or any other web-login based Internet access? Would you like to appear to be a user from a different country to avoid inconvenient content restrictions? Or would you prefer if your IP was not logged by every website you visit and everything you do logged by the NSA? Then look no further, you\'ve found the solution!\r\n\r\nOur Your Freedom service does all this for you, and more. It defeats censorship, it encrypts all your traffic, it hides your origin and identity, and it just makes things work that don\'t work without it. All you need is this app. There is a free service (called "FreeFreedom") available permanently to everyone who only needs occasional access and low bandwidth. If you need more, you can always upgrade later - once you know that it solves your problem and you need more than FreeFreedom provides.\r\n\r\nSupported tunnel modes:\r\n\r\n  * HTTPS\r\n  * HTTP/POST/CGI\r\n  * FTP\r\n  * UDP\r\n  * DNS\r\n  * ICMP ECHO (rooted phones only)\r\n\r\nWe have 39 tunnel servers in 10 countries.\r\n\r\nVisit our webpage https://www.your-freedom.net/ for in-depth information about our service. We appreciate if you send us crash reports when asked by your phone. To contact us about this app, send email to android@your-freedom.net.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to always receive the latest beta version instead of the production version and have all the latest features and bugs, please opt in at https://play.google.com/apps/testing/de.resolution.yf_android',
