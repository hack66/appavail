   [ 'When will you learn? Back in 2015 I gave this app 5 stars but now, I have to revoke 3 of them. Ever since Tumblr decided to become the next kids website, things have gone to all hell. Removing NSFW? Bright colors? What is this, coolmathgames? The porn bots are still here, Tumblr. Half my followers are porn bots at this point. You need to take a good look at what you\'re doing. I\'m not mad, I\'m disappointed.',
     'I used to use this app daily before they attempted to purge all NSFW content. Don\'t get me wrong, I understand why it was done. So, coming back, the app\'s design is pretty good, they fixed the tags option so its easier to use. People are complaining about the darker blue, but I can\'t see the difference. Anyways, as communities go, you\'re going to find something you don\'t like. But there may be a really good community for you! Just keep looking. :)',
     'Judy like about 95% of the reviews I just went through, I gotta say more or less the same thing, TUMBLR NOW SUCKS COW DICK. Really disappointed. Use to be my source for amazing pictures you can\'t find anywhere else. Now it\'s just a error filled oppressed wasteland. üñïüèª YOU TUMBLR',
     'Tumblr went down hill fast. Was an amazing blogging platform last year too. But now, been a member for over 5 years, and just had my account terminated the other day because they can\'t tell the difference between ecchi and hentai, and can\'t contact them about it. 100k followers, gone.',
     'Clicking keep reading doesn\'t go anywhere, just refreshes that page. Multiple blogs need to be completely separate, I don\'t want to see post and followers from my other blogs. No point in having more than one for different things. Wont change profile picture. Flags posts for no reason.' ],
