  comments:
   [ 'Excellent private messenger and wifi phone app. I\'ve used Signal for years and it\'s first rate. it\'s great as a group discussion spp too. i cannot think why anyone would use a so-called privacy messenger that\'s owned by Facebook, premier corporate mass surveillance company (WhatsApp). Ditch it and get your privacy app from a company you can trust! ,',
     'Concept is great! however, it is pretty buggy. Sometimes the Signal messages will be marked as sent but the other person won\'t recieve them. And MMS does not work at all. It says "tap to try again" but nothing happens. I had to stop using the SMS feature and havent had any trouble since. But that sucks! So hopefully those issues get ironed out sometime.',
     'Signal has been my go to messaging app for several years now, and several phones, ever since I discovered its existence following the Edward Snowden revelations of NSA spying on ordinary citizens. I have had no problems, it has worked flawlessly, and they keep improving it and adding functionality, so I will continue using it for the foreseeable future. If you want your information kept private, I highly recommend the app, particularly as FB messenger and WhatsApp allow users to be targeted.',
     'I like the service overall and the app is finally coming into its own. But why should I use this as my default SMS client if my text messages will be forever tied to signal? It\'ll gladly encrypt all your current sms and there is no sane way to export them to another client if I\'d like to try something else.',
     'Love it. I have managed to convince most of my friends and family to switch after explaining the benefits of doing so. Everyone gets a kick out of being able to look on their account history with their cell provider and not see any records of their texts with other Signal users :) Link previews in texts are a helpful new update. You can see & tell when someone has received, read, or is responding to a text. You can also automatically erase messages, just don\'t back them up like Manafort did! Ha!' ],
