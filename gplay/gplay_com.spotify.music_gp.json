   [ 'Can\'t beat it. Premium is worth every penny. Edit: Reduced to 3 stars. Might be worth every penny for me, but unfortunately that is not the case for the artists that put their music on the platform. If you use Spotify as you main method of listening to music, make sure to go to live shows for the artists you like, buy merch, donate, anything to help them get an extra few bucks. Spotify\'s royalty distribution model is flawed, so we need to make an effort to compensate.',
     'I HATE the new "improvement" of lumping what used to be "saved" songs into now a "liked playlist". I HATE how often big companies make stupid changes in today\'s world because some moron with lots of money--who doesn\'t even use their own app, play their own game, get affected by their own rules, etc.--gets to make decisions based on I guess what they think people will like, or more likely, because it makes it easier, cheaper, or more profitable for the company! I\'m canceling Premium and leaving.',
     'Lost bluetooth controls on my headphones and in my car. Music starts and stops. Can only skip songs via the app. The controls on the notification bar no longer work either. App was working fine before the last 2 updates. I also with the radio option was back. only shows thing I might like. I\'m a paying customer for the family plan. Disappointed with this app now.',
     'this new layout is awful. bring back the albums!!! its now literally impossible to find saved songs on albums. i wish you didn\'t have to save the ENTIRE album for it to apear in your albums. even the "liked songs" playlist is just bad. please revert it back to the old style!!! randomly starts playing even when no one touched the app. very dissapointed with this new update.',
     'the update really sucks. I used to be able to skip my songs just fine without unlocking my phone, now I have to. The new layout is awful and stupid looking. Also it\'s been really slow even when I\'m on the app and looking for music, and going from search button to my library. You dont even have the option of seeing your artist.' ],
